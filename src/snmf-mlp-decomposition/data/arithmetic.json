    "Excerpt from: Autism Speaks (click for full article)\nThis is an important question. Mood disorders – including depression – do appear to be more common in those with developmental disabilities than in the general population.\nHowever, diagnosing depression in those with autism represents a challenge that dates back to Leo Kanner’s original description of “infantile autism,” in 1943.\nKanner described a disturbance of “affective contact” in those with autism. Clinicians use the term “affect” to describe how someone’s emotional state appears to others. In other words, does the person look depressed or anxious? This can be different from “mood.” Mood refers to how someone actually feels inside.\nAffect and mood are not always aligned. For example, someone’s expression may appear flat and register little reaction. However, that person may say that he or she feels fine. Clinicians refer to this as an “incongruence of affect and mood.”",
    "Is Vinegar a Herbicide?Vinegar has shown promise as a broad spectrum herbicide. Effectiveness depends on the type of weed, the age of the weed and the concentration of the acetic acid in the vinegar. Household vinegar is a 5% acetic acid solution. Stronger concentrations of 15, 20 and 30% acetic acid are also available\nAll concentrations of acetic acid, including household vinegar, should cause treated foliage to brown within 24 hours. Young, tender weeds and annual weeds like crab grass are susceptible to treatment with household vinegar. However the roots are often not killed entirely and the weeds may reappear within a few weeks. Repeated applications, usually 3, are more effective and stronger concentrations of acetic acid work even faster and longer.\nWhat’s the Difference Between Acetic Acid and Vinegar?\nAcetic acid is created by fermenting alcohol. Household vinegar has a 5% solution of acetic acid made from the fermentation of plant products like grapes and apples. There are stronger concentrations of acetic acid available and even synthetically created acetic acid. All vinegars contain acetic acid, but not all acetic acid is vinegar.\nIs Vinegar Considered an Organic Control?\nIf the acetic acid in the product is created by the distillation or freeze-evaporation of plant sources, like household vinegar or the stronger concentrations sold for home canning, it is considered organic. Acetic acid made by synthetic processes is not.\nIs There Any Research to Support These Claims?The verdict is still out, but researchers are conducting studies and acetic acid looks promising. In a research experiment conducted during the Spring and Fall 2001 by the Sustainable Agricultural Systems Laboratory (SASL), a member of the Animal and Natural Resources Institute (ANRI) located in Beltsville, Maryland, they hand-sprayed common lambsquarters, giant foxtail, smooth pigweed and Canada thistle with 0.0, 5.0, 10.5, 15.3 and 20.2 percent vinegar. The results showed 2 things: the effectiveness of acetic acid on weeds depends on both the concentration and the plant growth stage.\n- Weaker concentrations (5 and 10%) worked well on young, more tender weeds.\n- Stronger concentrations (15 and 20%) were more effective on mature weeds.\nWill Vinegar Do Anything to My Soil?Being an acid, it can lower the soil’s pH a little. This is a temporary effect. Acetic acid breaks down quickly in water, so any residue will be pretty much gone after the first watering or rain.\nHow to Use Acetic Acid as a Herbicide.Vinegar is not labeled for use as a pesticide, so Extension agents aren’t able to recommend its use. But a homeowner can experiment. Household vinegar works well on young weeds. Repeated applications improve its effectiveness.\n- Spray it directly on the foliage and try for total saturation without too much run-off.\n- Don’t apply if rain is expected or before watering, since water breaks down acetic acid.\n- Avoid spraying any herbicide on windy days, to prevent it drifting onto plants you don’t want to kill.\nI’ve had great luck using vinegar on the weeds between the cracks on my sidewalk. I think the heat from the pavement helps the process along. I’ve had less luck with the perennial weeds that grow in my shady ‘turnaround’ area. These turned black, but rallied and grew back. I sprayed them a couple more times at 2-3 day intervals and they eventually died back. However, they reemerged again in a month or so.\nYou can also find stronger concentrations sold for canning purposes. These work faster and longer than household vinegar, but are caustic and should be handled with caution. Keep it off your skin and away from your eyes\nAnother option is to use one of the commercial herbicides on the market. Look for them in the weed killer section of your local garden centers, under names like: Fast Acting Burn Out (St. Gabriel Labs), Nature's Glory Weed and Grass Killer and Blackberry and Brush Block (Greenergy).",
    "One in eight high school students is depressed. But depression in teenagers can be deceptive, and authorities estimate that a huge number of depressed teens are undiagnosed. Adults may mistake symptoms as \"typical\" teen angst, anger, or anxiety. Or the teen may mask the symptoms with high-energy activity.\nFor parents who suspect their teen is depressed, the system often fails the family. Insurance coverage for treatment ends too soon, there's a months-long wait to see an adolescent therapist, or long-term follow-up is insufficient.\nThis means parents must take charge of their child's health to reinforce, extend, and monitor treatment and its aftermath. The good news is they can do it—because parents know their child best.\nAlthough a medical doctor, Dr. Berlinger initially missed the signs of his own son's depression. By combining his parental love with his scientific skills, he developed a set of techniques to lead his son out of depression. Now he shares his 10 Parental Partnering Strategies to help parents rescue their teen from depression—based on his own experiences, nearly 100 interviews with parents of depressed teens, and interviews with mental health professionals.\nIncreasingly, doctors are asking parents to partner with them to help children get healthy and stay healthy. Partnering has been proven effective in the treatment of other serious emotional illnesses such as anorexia nervosa.\nParents can use Dr. Berlinger's strategies to help distinguish depression from moodiness; be alert to suicide risk; monitor medication effectiveness; help the teen combat negative thinking; organize activities to offset depression; and spot signs of relapse during tense times in their child's life, including exams, relationship breakups, or starting college or a job.\nBoth a family survival story and a practical guide, this book affirms parents' unique power to help teens overcome depression.",
    "Date: September 16th 2006\nHair loss is experienced by all of us at one or the other time. To know the causes of hair fall, it is very essential to know the structure of hair and its normal growth cycle.\nStructure of hair\nThe hair on our scalp can be divided into two parts, the root and shaft. The root part of hair is in the skin (epidermis) of scalp. The hair root is surrounded by a pouch like structure called follicle. The base of hair root is in the shape of a bulb. This bulb is indented by capillaries and nerve fibers. The cells in the center of bulb divide. The newly divided hair cells push the previous cells up. The cells which move upwards die slowly forming hard hair shaft. The hair shaft has three layers the cuticle, medulla and cortex.Cuticle is the outer layers and protects the inner layers. It is transparent. Healthy cuticle gives a shiny appearance for hair and unhealthy cuticle gives lifeless look. The medulla is the innermost layer composed of large cells. The cortex is the layer between cuticle and medulla. This contains pigment and keratin. Cortex determines the bulk and strength of hair. The hair follicle contains oil secreting glands which make the hair shiny.Stress and illness diminish secretion of oil and pigments causing graying of hair.According to Ayurveda the hair is considered as a tissue which uses the same nutrients of bone and considered as a tissue which is formed as bi-product of bone tissue.\nNormal cycle of hair growth.\nAbout 10 % of the hair on the scalp is in a resting phase at any given time. The resting hair falls after 2 to 3 months and new hair starts growing in its place. The growing phase continues for 2.25 to 6 yrs. During this phase each hair grows approximately 1 cm per month. At any given time about 90% of the hair on scalp will be in growing phase. Few strands of hair fall as the part of normal hair growth cycle. But some people may experience excessive hair fall which is more than normal cycle. Excessive hair loss can affect men, women and children.\nCauses of hair loss\n1. Hormonal imbalance in men and women: In men high concentration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in hair follicles causes hair fall. In women hormonal imbalances during pregnancy and after delivery cause hair fall.\n2. High amount of sebum in scalp clogs pores of scalp and prevent nutrition to hair follicle.\n3. Inadequate nutrition causes hair fall.\n4. Stress, worry, lack of sleep, worry and anxiety cause hair fall\n5. Long standing diseases like typhoid, viral infections, anemia, surgery etc cause general debility which lead to hair fall\n6. Some medicines used for gout, chemo therapy of cancer, birth control pills, antidepressants etc cause hair fall\n7. Diseases like lupus, diabetes cause hair fall.\n8. Tying hair tightly pulls the hair from follicles and cause traction alopecia.\n9. Heredity also causes hair fall.\n10. Dandruff or Fungal infection of scalp. 11. Accumulation of dirt on scalp causes blocking of pores and weakens hair roots. This leads to hair fall.\nAccording to ayurveda the causes of hair loss are described as follows:-\n1. Too much exposure to dust, sunlight, water and other pollutants.\n2. Too much of sweating.\n3. Irregular sleeping pattern.\n4. Anxiety, depression, insomnia.\n5. Unhygienic way of living\n7. Alcohol consumption.\nHair Loss Remedies\n1. Liberal intake of vitamins.\n2. High protein and iron rich diet.\n3. Consumption of raw vegetables, fresh fruits, salads, green leafy vegetables regularly.\n4. Washing hair regularly ( twice weekly ) with suitable shampoo.\n5. Using relaxing techniques to overcome stress, anxiety and sleeplessness.\n6. Preventing fungal infections of scalp.\n7. Preventing hairstyles which pull hair.\nDue to these causes the tridoshas get vitiated and cause hair loss. The vitiated doshas affect the scalp skin and cause hair fall occurs. Medicated oil with the herbs Bhringaraja ( Eclipta Alba ), Amalaki ( Embelica officinalis ), Haritaki ( Terminalia chebula ) and Vibhitaki ( Terminalia bellirica ) is a best remedy for hair fall.\nLeave a Reply\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.",
    "The Torah reading of this week concludes with a discussion of the sin of blaspheming the name of God. The Torah places this prohibition within an anecdotal context, describing an event that occurred in the camp of the Jewish people in the desert of Sinai. Two Jews had a quarrel that rapidly disintegrated into a public fight. The quarrel originally had to do with the ancestry of one of the Jews. When the quarrel between the two Jews finally went out of control, the act of blasphemy of God's name took place. There is, in my opinion, a strong connection and lesson involved in the juxtaposition of these events.\nAnti-God utterances and events, so to speak, are rarely if ever, occasioned in a vacuum. It is usually the behavior or speech of a human that evokes a response that eventually refers to God. There are events in life, tragedies or inexplicable events, that may trigger such a response as well. But, overwhelmingly, blasphemy of God's name occurs when human behavior towards other humans is involved. And this is especially true when the subject matter of the dispute between the people involved is connected to matters of religion, ritual, faith and belief. This was the case in the dispute recorded in the Torah reading of this week and it was the insulting of one Jew by another that became the direct cause of the blasphemy of God's name that followed. Bad and false ideas, distortion of laws and tradition, improper behavior, are all entitled to direct and forceful criticism. However, personal demonization and venomous insults, even if allegedly made in the name of a just cause, lead eventually to a desecration and blasphemy of God's name.\nThere is much shouting and quarrelling in the Jewish world today. The noise is so great that we can no longer hear each other, let alone attempt to understand the other person. And each side feels justified in its pursuit of the quarrel, for there are major and fundamental life issues involved. But when the matter gets out of hand, when it is personalized and is no longer a matter of issues but of people, the blasphemy of God's name is never far distant. Much of our present quarrelling has become institutionalized. It is organizational. There are political parties and social and religious groups within the Jewish people today whose sole apparent purpose is to oppose and personally demonize other Jewish groups and people. That is not much of a raison d'etre to exist. Negativism breeds negativism, hatred breeds hatred, and all of it leads to the cardinal sin in Judaism - the desecration and blasphemy of God's name. We should attempt at all costs to avoid falling into this failing and communal trap. It can, as it did in the case of the original blasphemer recorded in Emor, lead to, God forbid, death and destruction.\nRabbi Berel Wein\nText Copyright © 2000 Rabbi Berel Wein and\nProject Genesis, Inc.",

Education does not necessarily ensure honesty. Theodore Roosevelt once declared, \"A man who has never gone to school may steal from a freight car; but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad\" (ctd. in Allen, n.d, Great Quotes--Education). Let us not judge. Intelligence can be defined as the capacity for understanding, thinking, and reasoning. An education, specifically a college education, can help me to gain the skills to understand, think, and reason on a more intellectual level. The formal education process for a college degree was formed to develop such skills.\nI have always believed that general education courses, which are a mandatory part of the acquisition of a bachelor's degree, are useless and unnecessary. These courses help to shape me into a professional person that I want to be by giving me a foundation in several subject areas and assisting me in determining an appropriate intellectual path throughout my long pursuit of a college degree. Courses in arts, social sciences, science and technology, English, and humanities allow me to learn about the world in which I live from different perspectives. Courses in the arts can help me to build a creative skill. The social sciences contain courses in psychology and sociology which deal with the study of the human mind and people, respectively. Science and technology courses can teach me about the world from a mathematical, scientific, and technological perspective.

    "John Millington Synge\nSynge, John Millington (sĭng) [key], 1871–1909, Irish poet and dramatist, b. near Dublin, of Protestant parents. He was an important figure in the Irish literary renaissance. As a young man he studied music in Germany and later lived in Paris, where he wrote literary criticism. In Paris he met his compatriot W. B. Yeats, who persuaded Synge to live for a while in the Aran Islands and then return to Dublin and devote himself to creative work. All of Synge's plays reflect his experiences in the Aran Islands. Intense and poetic in style, his works depict the bleak and tragic lives of Irish peasants and fisherfolk. His first two one-act plays— In the Shadow of the Glen (1903), a comedy, and Riders to the Sea (1904), a tragedy—were presented by the Irish National Theatre Society. In 1904 this group, with Synge, Yeats, and Lady Augusta Gregory as codirectors, organized the famous Abbey Theatre. Two of Synge's comedies, The Well of the Saints (1905) and The Playboy of the Western World (1907), were presented by the Abbey players. The latter play created a furor of resentment among Irish patriots stung by Synge's spoof of heroic ideals and nationalism. His later works were The Tinker's Wedding, published in 1908 but not produced for fear of further riots, and Deirdre of the Sorrows, a tragedy unfinished at the time of his death but presented by the Abbey players in 1910. The Aran Islands (1907) is Synge's journal of his stay on the islands.\nSee biographies by D. H. Greene and E. M. Stephens (1959) and D. Gerstenberger (1964); studies by D.

    "Polarized Starlight and the Handedness of Life\nThe asymmetry of the amino acid molecules found in all living things may have originated in space billions of years ago\nWhereas amino acids produced by inorganic reactions are equally split between two mirror-image versions, the amino acids found in living things are almost universally \"left-handed.\" The origin of this biological homochirality, as it is called, has been clouded in mystery, but a group of astronomers may have stumbled on the answer. They found that the light passing through large parts of the cosmos is sometimes circularly polarized in one direction. Such radiation can preferentially destroy one version of the amino acid molecules that form in space along with other complex organic compounds. A similar occurrence five billion years ago may have seeded the solar system and the early earth with a lopsided mix of amino acids, which would have favored one handedness over the other when life evolved from these organic molecules.\nGo to Article",
    "Computers, machines and even smart phones can process sounds and audio signals with apparent ease, but they all require significant computing power.\nA brain-based pattern-recognition process that searches for familiar features in the audio spectrum improves sound recognition in computers.\nCopyright : 2013 A*STAR Institute for Infocomm Research\nResearchers from the A*STAR Institute for Infocomm Research in Singapore have proposed a way to improve computer audio processing by applying lessons inspired from the way the brain processes sounds.\n“The method proposed in our study may not only contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which the biological acoustic systems operate, but also enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of audio processing,” comments Huajin Tang, an electrical engineer from the research team.\nWhen listening to someone speaking in a quiet room, it is easy to identify the speaker and understand their words. While the same words spoken in a loud bar are more difficult to process, our brain is still capable of distinguishing the voice of the speaker from the background noise. Computers, on the other hand, still have considerable problems identifying complex sounds from a noisy background; even smart phones must send audio signals to a powerful centralized server for processing.\nConsiderable computing power at the server is required because the computer continuously processes the entire spectrum of human audio frequencies. The brain, however, analyzes information more selectively: it processes audio patterns localized in time and frequency (see image). When someone speaks with a deep voice, for example, the brain dispenses with analyzing high-pitched sounds. So when a speaker in a loud bar stops talking, the brain stops trying to catch and process the sounds that form his words.\nTang and his team emulated the brain’s sound-recognition strategy by identifying key points in the audio spectrum of a sound. These points could be characteristic frequencies in a voice or repeating patterns, such as those of an alarm bell. They analyzed the signal in more detail around these key points only, looking for familiar audio frequencies as well as time patterns. This analysis enabled a robust extraction of matching signals when a noise was present. To improve the detection over time, the researchers fed matching frequency patterns into a neurological algorithm that mimics the way the brain learns through the repetition of known patterns.\nIn computer experiments, the algorithm successfully processed known target signals, even in the presence of noise. Expanding this approach, says Tang, “could lead to a greater understanding of the way the brain processes sound; and, beyond that, it could also include touch, vision and other senses.”\nDennis, J., Yu, Q., Tang, H., Tran, H.

    "While still a youth Paracelsus became aware of many of the conflicting currents of his age. His father was a physician in Einsiedeln and he practiced in a number of mining towns. The boy surely learned some practical medicine at home through observing his father. It is likely that he learned some folk medicine as well. He also picked up some alchemy from his father who had an interest in the subject. And in mining towns he would have observed metallurgical practices as well as the diseases that afflicted the men who worked the mines. Traditionally it has been said that Paracelsus was taught by several bishops and the occultist abbot of Sponheim, Johannes Trithemius. At the age of fourteen the boy left home to begin a long period of wandering. He apparently visited a number of universities, but there is no proof that he ever took a medical degree. As an adult, however, he picked up practical medical knowledge by working as a surgeon in a number of the mercenary armies that ravaged Europe in the seemingly endless wars of the period. He wrote that he visited most of the countries of Central, Northern, and Eastern Europe.\nIt is only in the final fifteen years of his life that the records of his travels become clearer. In 1527 he was called to Basel to treat a leg ailment of the famed publisher of humanist classics, Johannes Frobenius. In Basel Paracelsus also gave medical advice to the Dutch scholar Erasmus and came in contact with some of the more prominent scholars of the religious Reformation. He was appointed city physician and professor of medicine. But although he was permitted to lecture at the University of Basel, he had no official appointment with the medical faculty there.\nAlmost immediately Paracelsus became a figure of contention. He heaped scorn on the conservative physicians of the University, and, at the St. John's Day bonfire, threw Avicenna's revered Canon of medicine to the blaze. Then, his patient, Frobenius, died. This was followed by a disastrous lawsuit and he left Basel in haste, even leaving behind his manuscripts.\nThe final years of his life find Paracelsus moving from town to town, and again, he often left his manuscripts behind as he had in Basel. He comes across as an angry man who antagonized many of those he met -- even those who tried to help him. In the end he was called to Salzburg to treat the suffragan bishop, Ernest of Wittelsbach. There he died at the early age of forty-eight.",

    "Mar. 20, 2008 New research led by UC Davis anthropologist Tim Weaver adds to the evidence that chance, rather than natural selection, best explains why the skulls of modern humans and ancient Neanderthals evolved differently. The findings may alter how anthropologists think about human evolution.\nWeaver's study appears in the March 17 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It builds on findings from a study he and his colleagues published last year in the Journal of Human Evolution, in which the team compared cranial measurements of 2,524 modern human skulls and 20 Neanderthal specimens. The researchers concluded that random genetic change, or genetic drift, most likely account for the cranial differences.\nIn their new study, Weaver and his colleagues crunched their fossil data using sophisticated mathematical models -- and calculated that Neanderthals and modern humans split about 370,000 years ago. The estimate is very close to estimates derived by other researchers who have dated the split based on clues from ancient Neanderthal and modern-day human DNA sequences.\nThe close correlation of the two estimates -- one based on studying bones, one based on studying genes -- demonstrates that the fossil record and analyses of DNA sequences give a consistent picture of human evolution during this time period.\n\"A take-home message may be that we should reconsider the idea that all morphological (physical) changes are due to natural selection, and instead consider that some of them may be due to genetic drift,\" Weaver said. \"This may have interesting implications for our understanding of human evolution.\"\nWeaver conducted the research with Charles Roseman, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Chris Stringer, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London.\nOther social bookmarking and sharing tools:\nNote: Materials may be edited for content and length.

    "Should the concept of an autism \"spectrum\" of disorders be abandoned?\nThe DSM III originally included strict criteria for Kanner's infantile autism. These strict criteria were relaxed in the DSM III-R which \"broadened the concept of autism to include children who, although socially impaired, are not pervasively unresponsive to others(1)\". Another huge expansion took place with the DSM IV inclusion of Asperger Disorder in the Pervasive Development Disorders category: \"Asperger Disorder is characterized by the same types of social impairments seen in autism plus the development of very bizarre intense interests such as bus timetables, insects, meteorology, cartography, etc. It is distinguished from autism by the presence of normal cognitive development and the absence of clinically significant language delay. In other words, children with Asperger Disorder have normal IQ and usually are speaking in phrases by three years of age.(2)\"\nThe PDD's have in common usage become referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorders and from there it has become common to refer to all forms of PDD's as \"Autism\". The expansion of the autism \"spectrum\" has been cited each time an increase in rates of autism diagnoses is reported. When my son was initially diagnosed in 1998 the figure of 1 in 500 persons having \"autism\" was commonly cited, then 1 in 250, 1 in 166, then 1 in 150 and soon the CDC is expected to fall in line with the UK figure of 1 in 100. Each time the estimate changes the expansion of the criteria for defining \"autism\" is trotted out to argue against the existence of a real increase in autism.\nThe expansion of the diagnostic criteria of \"autism\" disorders have become a useful tool for public health officials who wish to maintain the position that autism is entirely genetic, that there are no environmental causes and especially that autism can not be triggered by vaccines. It helps in justifying the enormous disparity in funding genetic autism research compared to environmental autism research. In 1999 Teresa Binstock reported the \"it's gotta be genetic\" paradigm of autism research funding. Ten years later Irva Hertz-Picciotto states that the discrepancy is still between 10 or 20 to 1 in favor of genetic over environmental autism research funding. The expanded definition explanation has been used, used again, and again in justifying the argument that there is no real increase in autism increase, that autism is entirely genetic.\nThe expanded definition of autism to include High Functioning Autism cases and Asperger Disorder creates confusion in the public mind over what constitutes autism and leads to conflict amongst persons affected by \"autism\". To many members of the public an autistic person is someone like Michelle Dawson, a former Canada Post postal worker who excelled in a very complex work environment, went on to become a researcher, appear before the highest court in Canada, before Human Rights Tribunals and in countless media interviews. They do not see the autistic person who can not speak OR communicate with assistive technology. The public does not see the persons with Autistic Disorder living their lives in institutional care.\nPersons with Asperger and HFA often react to what they call negative depictions of autism which they no longer consider to be a medical disorder, equating autism with left handedness or homosexuality as differences not disorders. The recent anger amongst persons with HFA and Asperger Disorder over the \"I Am Autism\" video is directed at the depiction of some of the harsh realities that often accompany Autistic Disorder. These people do not want to be associated with intellectual deficits, serious behavioral issues or serious family or societal expense. It hurts and offends some with HFA and Aspergers to be compared to people with severe Autistic Disorder, people like my son.\nThe \"spectrum\" concept that helps create confusion also helps create some confusion in autism research. Researcher Dr. Laurent Mottron works almost exclusively with HFA/Asperger subjects and his research often been aimed at demonstrating the innate abilities of persons with HFA/Asperger Disorder. Historically Dr. Mottron was conscientious about pointing out that his subjects were persons with HFA/Asperger Disorder as opposed to persons with Low Functioning severe Autistic Disorder. Some recent studies have not made that distinction clear and his studies are also interpreted by many as applying to \"autism\" generally. It is difficult to compare autism studies or data over extended periods of time because of the different ways in which autism is referred to in the research literature with some making clear distinctions between low functioning Autistic Disorder and those with HFA or Aspergers while others simply refer to Autism.\nOne of the most bizarre consequences of the expanded definition of autism in the DSM-III R and DSM-IV is the attempt by some persons with Asperger Disorder to extinguish the right and responsibility of parents to speak on behalf of their autistic children or to seek treatment and cure for their children. The \"Autism\" Self Advocacy Network is led by Ari Ne'eman a very high functioning person with Asperger Disorder whose disorder would not have been included in the \"autism\" spectrum in the DSM-III or the DSM-III-R.\nWhy Mr. Ne'eman and his followers are not content to call themselves the Asperger Self Advocacy Network is not clear. Why this very high functioning person with Asperger Disorder feels that it is legitimate for him to speak on behalf of all persons with Autism Disorders of any type and declare that they do not want to be cured is not clear. Why he, and his followers, feel it necessary to lobby against any negative depiction of autism is not clear. Why he, and his followers, feel that they have the right to dictate to parents that they should not seek to treat or cure their own children of a severe neurological disorder is not clear.\nWhat is clear is that the Pervasive Development Disorder category of the DSM has morphed into the Autism Spectrum and from there to \"autism\" and this has not been helpful.\nMaybe it is time to abandon the Autism \"Spectrum\" and establish two separate categories with Autistic Disorder comprising classic autism while HFA and Aspergers Disorder are placed together in one category.... Aspergers Disorder.\nOr perhaps a better solution to the Autism Spectrum confusion would be to abandon the spectrum concept altogether by removing HFA and Asperger Disorder from the DSM leaving only Autistic Disorder as a category for those with severe or low functioning autism. Many persons with HFA and Aspergers argue that they do not have a medical disorder at all. Maybe it is time to acknowledge their arguments, remove Asperger Disorder from the DSM, and go back to the DSM III criteria for Infantile Autism or Autistic Disorder.",
    "Deep in a desiccated, Utah desert, surrounded by mountains and fringed with scorched sage and saltbush, stand the surreal remains of German Village. Out of bounds, out of place, out of time and 90 miles from Salt Lake City, it is surely the most bizarre feature of Dugway Proving Ground, a test site created by the Allied military during the second world war to develop weapons of mass destruction for use against civilian targets in Germany and Japan.\nAll that survives of German Village is a single block of high-gabled, prewar Berlin working-class housing. It is accurate in every respect. And it should be: commissioned by the chemical warfare corps of the US army, it was designed by Erich Mendelsohn (1887-1953), the German architect who settled in the US in 1941 after a spell in England.\nI was alerted to the story of German Village by Mike Davis, who features it in his provocative book Dead Cities: A Natural History, a study of the vulnerability of modern cities from New York to Tokyo to destruction by man and nature. Mendelsohn's involvement in this deathly project, seemed, at first, bizarre. A Jew from Allenstein in East Prussia (today, Olsztyn in Poland), Mendelsohn settled in Berlin, where he trained as an architect after studying economics in Munich. From the trenches of the great war he sent home visionary sketches of extraordinary streamlined, or expressionist, buildings. In 1919, during the great flu epidemic, he began work on the Einstein Tower, an astrophysics laboratory for the German mathematician and scientist, at Potsdam on the edge of Berlin.\nOver the next 10 or 12 years, Mendelsohn developed beautiful, sweeping, clean-lined, light-filled architecture - much of it in Berlin - that appeared to catch the spirit of the old German Enlightenment and represent it afresh in the uncertain days of the Weimar Republic. These included the Metal Workers Union building, the Universum Cinema on Kurfürstendamm, the Columbushaus (Galeries Lafayette) and several villas, including his own. Outside Berlin, the streamlined department stores he built for Schocken at Nuremberg, Stuttgart and Chemnitz were hugely influential worldwide.\nMendelsohn left for England when Hitler was voted into power in 1933. Here, with the Russian-born dandy Serge Chermayeff, he built, among a number of fine houses, the De la Warr Pavilion at Bexhill-on-Sea.\nHow can this Erich Mendelsohn be the architect of the dark and deathly German Village in the Utah desert? Mendelsohn left no correspondence or notebooks relating to the Dugway Proving Ground project, where napalm and poison gases were developed and tested. He had been under gas attack in the trenches, yet it is hard not to think that his primary motivation in the desert of Utah was revenge on the Nazis. If this seems fair enough, what remains disturbing is the fact that this work was expressly designed to destroy working-class districts of Berlin, including Wedding and Pankow. These had been communist strongholds, virulently anti-Hitler, before the Gestapo and SS all but destroyed opposition to the Nazi regime.\nA concerted Allied attack, by the British and US air force on working-class districts of German and Japanese cities had, however, become more or less official policy by 1943. Churchill wanted to gas them. Killed and mutilated in sufficient numbers, the German working class would, he argued, rise up against Hitler and bring a quick end to the war. \"It is absurd to consider morality on this topic,\" he told RAF planners when the first German V1 rockets fell on London. \"I want the matter studied in cold blood by sensible people, and not by psalm-singing uniformed defeatists.\"\nSensible people included the prime minister's favourite scientific adviser, Professor Frederick Lindemann (Lord Cherwell), who insisted that \"the bombing must be directed essentially against working-class houses. Middle-class houses have too much space around them, and so are bound to waste bombs.\" Psalm-singing uniformed defeatists included the US's air force's celebrated commander Jimmy Doolittle, who took against Churchill's proposed Operation Thunderclap that aimed to kill 275,000 Berliners in a single 2,000-plane raid scheduled for August 1944. It did not take place.\nWashington's war secretary Henry Stimson said he did not want \"the United States to get the reputation of outdoing Hitler in atrocities\". His less diplomatic deputy, Robert Lovett, pleading the case for adopting anti-personnel bombs loaded with napalm and white phosphorous, said: \"If we are going to have a total war, we might as well make it as horrible as possible.\" Churchill trumped Lovett by calling on US president Franklin D Roosevelt to speed up production of a promised 500,000 top-secret \"N-bombs\" - filled with anthrax, developed at Dugway - to be dropped on Berlin and five other German cities.\nAs the debate raged in political and military circles, Mendelsohn, with scientists from Standard Oil and German-emigre set designers from Hollywood's RKO studio, set to work on German Village. RKO expertise contributed the design of proletarian Berlin interiors down to the last detail. Using forced labour (inmates from Utah state prison), German Village and its six \"mietskasernen\" (rent barracks) apartment blocks were completed in 44 days, in time for experiments scheduled from May 1943.\nMendelsohn and his team had done a good job. Their designs were far superior to the German housing built in England for test destruction by the RAF at Harmondsworth, near Heathrow airport. Assaulted by napalm, gas, anthrax and incendiary bombs, German Village was rebuilt several times during 1943. Nearby, the Japanese Village (long since vanished), designed by the Czech-educated architect Antonin Raymond (1888-1976), paved the way for incendiary attacks on working-class districts of Tokyo. On March 9 1945, 334 US air force B-29 superfortress bombers dropped 2,000 tons of napalm and magnesium incendiaries on the timber and paper houses of Asakusa. Officially, 83,793 Japanese were killed, 40,918 injured and 265,171 buildings destroyed. The same month, German Village aided the fire raids on Dresden. By the time Germany surrendered in May 1945, US and British raids had destroyed 45% of German housing. And, as Davis wryly observes: \"Allied bombers pounded into rubble more 1920s socialist and modernist utopias than Nazi villas.\"Mendelsohn was the architect of some of the very best of these white, concrete dreams. Dugway, Davis argues, \"led the way to the deaths of, say, two million Axis civilians\", and German Village remains \"a monument to the self-righteousness of punishing 'bad places' by bombing them\".\nThere is no doubt that Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan had to be defeated; but did the Allies really need German Village, Japanese Village and the refined architectural efforts of Mendelsohn and Raymond? At the fiery dawn of the 20th century, beneath the civilised, enlightened facades of Britain and the US, as well as Germany and Japan, was a desire for expansion, destruction and terrible revenge. Sitting on the sun-deck of Mendelsohn's pavilion at Bexhill-on-Sea, this axis of modern evil seems so very far removed, as far away, in fact, as the sole surviving \"rent barrack\" of German Village, Utah.\n· Dead Cities: A Natural History by Mike Davis, The New Press, £16.95.",

    "UNC scientists find missing link between players in the epigenetic code\nOver the last two decades, scientists have come to understand that the genetic code held within DNA represents only part of the blueprint of life. The rest comes from specific patterns of chemical tags that overlay the DNA structure, determining how tightly the DNA is packaged and how accessible certain genes are to be switched on or off. Now, research from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine has established the first link between the two most fundamental epigenetic tags -- histone modification and DNA methylation -- in humans. The study, which was published Sept. 30, 2012 by the journal Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, implicates a protein called UHRF1 in the maintenance of these epigenetic tags. Because the protein has been found to be defective in cancer, the finding could help scientists understand not only how microscopic chemical changes can ultimately affect the epigenetic landscape but also give clues to the underlying causes of disease and cancer. UNC is home to the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center.\nAmong the research institutions NCI funds across the United States, it currently designates 67 as Cancer Centers. Largely based in research universities, these facilities are home to many of the NCI-supported scientists who conduct a wide range of intense, laboratory research into cancer’s origins and development.

    "It was an abrupt ending to what was a wonderful time with our North Korean orphan, \"Jae Hwa\". One evening about two years ago, a child in one of our group homes said she was leaving for a boarding school nearby. The house fell under a muffled silence after she left, as if covered in a thick blanket. Jae Hwa had been planning this with her father for months but nobody in the home knew.\nLike all the children in this home, Jae Hwa’s mother was North Korean refugee who was purchased by a Chinese man. Her mother was captured by the Chinese police and sent back to a North Korean prison camp when Jae Hwa was eight-years-old. She came into Crossing Borders’ care in 2011, when she was 13-years-old.\nJae Hwa’s father went to South Korea to find work and kept in touch with his daughter by text message via the smart phone he purchased her.\nThe children in this home were allowed to have smart phones for this very purpose. As time went on, these phones became a nuisance. The kids were using them to play games and to text with their friends. It became harder to hold their attention and this led to conflict as the caretakers of this home would sometimes take these phones away.\nParents around the world are grappling with how to control their children’s smartphone use and so too are the caretakers of our North Kroean orphans. Not only do they have to deal with them as distractions but they must also be wary of the way our children portray their living conditions in these homes to their parents.\nJae Hwa would tell her father that she felt trapped in her home, that her caretakers were too strict and that she was unhappy. These accounts, one must note, were filtered through the lens of a teenage girl. She didn’t report any abuse or specific incidents of wrongdoing. What drove her away was the rigid structure of the home, something teens around the world struggle with.\nTeenagers are impulsive. They make poor choices. They are reckless.\nIn 2012, National Geographic Magazine published a fascinating study on the teenage brain. It was once thought that brains are fully developed by the age of 10, recent studies found that teenagers have brains that are about 90 percent developed. This development could be one of the reasons why teenagers are so impulsive, the study said.\n“These studies help explain why teens behave with such vexing inconsistency: beguiling at breakfast, disgusting at dinner; masterful on Monday, sleepwalking on Saturday,” the writer says. “Along with lacking experience generally, they're still learning to use their brain's new networks.”’\nThis might explain one of the factors to what we consider a poor decision on the part of Jae Hwa.\nShe thought that living in a dorm would allow her to do what she wanted. She thought that she would be able to go to play games at a local PC gaming business through the night. She thought she would be able to go to parties.\nShe realized that this wasn’t true at all.\nHer dormitory has strict rules and in some ways is even stricter than her Crossing Borders group home.\nOur caretakers are adjusting now. They are now loosening the grip they once held on our North Korean orphans. They are now allowed to go to birthday parties and their schedules are less rigid but for now, smartphones are banned in this home.\nJae Hwa visits the home every weekend for church and even brings her classmates along. She looks thin. She doesn’t like the food at the dorm and it does not offer meals on the weekends.\nEvery weekend our caretakers take Jae Hwa grocery shopping and they cook her any meal that she wants. They tell her repeatedly that she could come back to the home but she does not. Her father will not allow it based on the testimony she once gave him.\nFor now, all we can offer her are some meals, prayers and an open door.",

    "Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a term that describes a baby who is not growing at the normal rate inside the uterus. These babies usually have a low weight at birth.\nNo. About one-third of the babies who are small at birth have IUGR. The rest of them don't have IUGR--they're just smaller than normal. Just like there are different sizes of infants, children and adults, there are also different sizes of babies in the uterus. Small babies tend to run in families. The parents or other children in the family may have been small when they were born, too.\nBabies who have IUGR are more likely to have certain health problems (both during pregnancy and after birth). Problems include:\nYour baby will probably catch up in size and have a normal height by about 2 years of age.\nIUGR has various causes. The most common cause is a problem in the placenta (the tissue that carries oxygen, food and blood to the baby). Birth defects and genetic disorders can also cause IUGR. If the mother has an infection, high blood pressure, kidney disease, heart disease or sickle cell anemia, or is smoking, drinking alcohol or abusing drugs, her baby might develop IUGR. Sometimes a prescribed medicine that the mother is taking causes IUGR.\nMost of the causes of IUGR are beyond your control. Usually, nothing the mother did causes IUGR in her baby. But if you smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or abuse drugs, you can cause IUGR in your baby.\nGenerally, no. IUGR usually doesn't occur in another pregnancy. But in some women, it does happen again. Women who have another pregnancy affected by IUGR usually have an illness, such as hypertension, that causes IUGR. Good control of illnesses before and during pregnancy lowers the risk of having another baby with IUGR.\nDuring your pregnancy, your doctor will do tests to find out if your baby is growing normally. The main test for checking a baby's growth in the uterus is an ultrasound. The ultrasound exam lets your doctor see your baby in your uterus with an instrument that is moved across your abdomen.\nWhile you are having an ultrasound exam, your doctor will measure the size of your baby's head, abdomen and legs. These measurements will tell you and your doctor if your baby is growing normally. Your doctor will also find out the amount of amniotic fluid in your uterus. In some babies who have IUGR, the amount of amniotic fluid is low. If your baby is small, ultrasound exams may be done more often than usual to check your baby's health.\nOne test is fetal monitoring. It's a way to check your baby's health inside your uterus. Straps are put over your uterus as you lie down for about 30 minutes. You will hear your baby's heartbeat as it is recorded. Your doctor can look at the recording and see if your baby's heartbeat is normal.\nYou might also have an amniocentesis. A needle is put through your skin into your uterus. A few teaspoons of amniotic fluid are withdrawn in the needle. The fluid is tested to see if it shows the cause of the IUGR. The amniotic fluid can detect infection and some chromosomal abnormalities that can cause genetic problems.\nThe best way to help your baby is to keep all of your prenatal visits with your doctor. You should also monitor how often your baby moves and kicks. A baby who moves around often is usually healthy. A baby who doesn't move very often or who stops moving may be sick. If you notice your baby isn't moving as much, call your doctor.\nAnother way you can help your baby is to take good care of your body. Eat plenty of healthy foods and take in the recommended amount of calories for a pregnant woman. Rest will help you feel better and it may even help your baby grow. Try to get 8 hours of sleep (or more) each night. An hour or 2 of rest in the afternoon is also good for you. Finally, if you smoke, drink alcohol or use drugs, stop now. These things can hurt your baby. This may be all that is needed to improve your baby's health, as well as your own.\nMaybe not. The time of delivery depends on how well your baby is doing. Sometimes, babies with IUGR keep on growing in the uterus. If your baby keeps gaining some weight, an early delivery may not be needed. But if your baby is not growing at all or has other problems, your doctor may decide that an early delivery could help. In this case, your doctor may want to induce labor. Your baby's heart rate and movements will be closely watched to help you and your doctor make this decision.\nIf there are no signs of problems with your baby during labor, a vaginal delivery is okay. Some babies with IUGR are weak. The stress of labor and delivery may be too much for a weak baby. If your baby has problems during labor, a cesarean section (also called a C-section) may be safer.\nProbably, especially if your baby was born early. Babies who are small at birth need to stay in the hospital until they can breathe and feed normally. After your baby is born, the doctor will check your baby's weight to make sure the baby is growing. Generally, babies stay in the hospital until they weigh about 5 pounds and can breathe and feed normally.\nIntrauterine Growth Restriction: Identification and Management by David Peleg, M.D., Collen M.

    "Killer Bobble-Headed Penguins!\nSpheniscus penguins are your basic model. Collectively, the four living species are sometimes known as “tuxedo penguins” for their striking color patterns, which resemble a tuxedo motif just a bit more than those of other types of penguins. These four species are among the most warm-weather adapted of modern penguins, and live in Africa, South America and the Galapagos Islands. Spheniscus penguins also have a really good fossil record, with lots of skeletons discovered in the past few years in places like Peru and Chile. Many of these specimens are very similar to the living Humboldt Penguin (Spheniscus humboldti), which plies the coasts of South America today. However, two species stand out for their remarkable appearance.\nSpheniscus urbinai and Spheniscus megaramphus were discovered in the prolific fossil deposits of the Peruvian Atacama Desert (also referred to a the Sechura Desert). These penguins appear to be standard, although slightly larger, versions of the basic Spheniscus plan from the toes up the neck. Flippers, legs, vertebrae – all these bones are not easily distinguishable from the same elements in a Humboldt Penguin to the untrained eye. The head, though, is a different story. These two penguins have “bobble heads” – skulls that are proportionally too big for their body. Well, too big for a normal penguin’s body anyway – no one seems to have sent a memo to Spheniscus urbinai or Spheniscus megaramphus. Aside from the big heads, these penguins had killer beaks. The tips, instead of being straight like many fossil penguins or lightly down-turned like most modern species, were powerfully developed into a sharp menacing hook. This is a style of beak often seen in aeriel predators like eagles and fish-snatching birds like frigatebirds.\nOne of the basic facts about fossil bird beaks is that they tend to tell only half the story. That is because the bony part of the beak is covered by a layer of keratin in life. This sheath can greatly extend the tip of the bill in some species, and Spheniscus penguins are a perfect example. The bony beaks of these birds have a modest sharp hook at the tip. When the sheath is added though, the tips start looking pretty fierce. Adding the keratin layer to Spheniscus urbinai and Spheniscus megaramphus would rachet up the beak from menacing to downright scary. What were these fossil species doing with there intimidating beaks? Most likely catching tough prey. A powerful hook would be well suited to ripping into fish and squid, and is more useful for holding onto a larger victim than gathering up tiny things like sardines. Whatever their ecology, the bobble-headed Spheniscus species did not make it to the present day. After splitting off from the main Spheniscus lineage around 6 million years ago, Spheniscus urbinai and Spheniscus megaramphus enjoined a few million years of successful hunting before vanishing.",

    "Create out-of-focus highlights from scratch with a little help from Photoshop CS6’s new time-saving shortcuts, in this easy to follow, four-step tutorial.\nBokeh is a Japanese word that translates as blur or haze. In photography it is used to refer to the quality of the area beyond your depth of field that is out of focus.\nThe look of the bokeh effect is down to a number of factors, including the lens you’re using, your chosen aperture and how far your subject is from the background. In this tutorial, we explain how to use the time-saving shortcuts in Photoshop CS6 to create out-of-focus highlights in four easy steps.\n01. Make a circle\nMake a new document (File>New) and fill it with black. Create a new layer, then grab the Elliptical Marquee tool, hold down Shift and drag a circular selection. Go to Select>Modify> Feather. Set Radius 10px and then hit OK. Choose a bright foreground colour then hit Alt+Backspace to fill the circle.\n02. Make quick copies\nGrab the Move tool and check ‘Show Transform Controls’. Hold Alt and drag the circle to make a copy. Repeatedly Alt-drag the circles around to make more copies while varying colour and size. Press Cmd/Ctrl+U and adjust the Hue slider to change colours. Hold Shift and drag the corner of the bounding box to resize.\n03. Add variety\nFor more variation, highlight different layers and hit 1-9 to quickly set a layer Opacity between 10-90%. Also, go to Filter>Blur>Gaussian Blur, set Radius 10px and hit OK. Hit Cmd/Ctrl+F to repeat the blur effect on other circles.\n04. Group and dupe\nShift-click from top to bottom to highlight all the circle layers then choose Blend Mode: Linear Dodge (Add). Press Cmd/Ctrl+G to group the layers together, then hit Cmd/Ctrl+J to duplicate the group. Grab the Move tool, click the bounding box, then position and resize the new group. You can make further copies to build up the effect.\nThis tutorial first appeared in Practical Photoshop magazine, the number one magazine for lovers of photography and image-editing.

    "A safety demonstration of the latest automobile technology let reporters take a peek at what could possibly be the future of our nation’s highways.\nThe technology being shown off is known as Vehicle to Vehicle Communication, also known as V2V. It’s something that you may have heard of, especially if you follow this blog regularly. It basically works like this: vehicles equipped with the safety technology will essentially be able to communicate directly with one another, exchanging data on speed, direction, and more. This data can then be computed to determine if a crash is imminent.\nAt a demonstration recently, reporters were able to view a Ford Taurus driving toward an intersection. Before the vehicle was able to get there, though, red lights blinked in the driver’s field of view and a warning of imminent danger was issued. The driver stopped at the intersection just before a vehicle hidden behind a truck blasted through the intersection on a perpendicular path.\nIn that instance, and in many more potentialities, the technology might save a life in a real-world situation. Current technologies often relies on lasers, and thus a line of sight must be achieved in order to maintain optimum working ability, but the newest form of the tech won’t require that kind of vision. Drivers will be alerted without even having to see the danger looming.\nThis year will see 3,000 vehicles implementing the technology in Ann Arbor, Michigan as part of a test to see how the automobiles will handle V2V in the real world.",
    "Black fever, also known as visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is the second-largest parasitic killer in the world (after malaria), responsible for an estimated half-million deaths worldwide. Roughly 90 percent of black fever cases worldwide are found in Bihar State in India and in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan and northeastern Brazil. Because these populations are so poor, new drugs are slow to emerge and much of the basic research into potential drug targets takes place in universities, funded by charitable organisations. The Institute for OneWorld Health charity is developing the drug paromomycin, which they claim will be effective and cheap. A treatment with paromomycin will cost about $10. The drug had originally been identified in th 1960's, but had been abandoned because it would not be profitable, as the disease mostly affects poor people.\nDr. Hale and her husband, Dr. Ahvie Herskowitz put up $100,000, signed a $315,000 promissory note, used the ground floor of their house as offices, and worked without pay for two years. The idea of a nonprofit drug company struck many as folly when Dr. Victoria Hale, a former Genentech executive and Food and Drug Administration official, founded OneWorld Health in 2001. The Gates foundation, which at the time was primarily underwriting vaccines and other preventive strategies, eventually offered a grant of $4.2 million that grew to $47.2 million for the development of paromomycin. Dr. Hale also got help from others, including the Skoll Foundation, which has provided financing to underwrite salaries for new senior executives. If approval is granted as expected this fall, it will be the first time a charity has succeeded in ushering a drug to market.\nSource article from New York Times",

    "Detoxifying the body has become an apparent key preventative measure for all kinds of health problems. Since most of us are busy and unable or unwilling to maintain a strict diet in order to completely eliminate all the toxins from our body, we have chemicals building up in our bodies day after day. Since these chemicals are not harmful in small amounts, only in larger accumulated amounts, we don't notice side effects until we are much older. A proper, even if occasional, detox diet is necessary to relieve our bodies of harmful toxins and chemicals and maintain a healthy, normal, and long-lived life.\nThe main idea of a detox diet is to eliminate nearly all foods and restrict the body to only water and vegetables for a few days; usually around 5 or 6 days is adequate. Most detox diets then allow for a gradual re-introduction of other foods. The diets generally restrict foods from your diet that are said to have harmful toxins. Along with this, a detox diet should then flush the existing toxins out of the body. A detox diet essentially gives the liver and other organs a chance to catch up and remove all the toxins. This is done through our sweat, faeces and urine.\nOur bodies simply cannot cope with the normal day to day ingestion of chemicals. Most these chemicals come from foods, as mentioned before, but also have a wide variety of other sources. Although we do not know which foods are the cause of it all, we do know that pesticides, heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, and the chemicals in cigarettes and the air we breath, all enter our bodies via our lungs or stomach and can cause an excessive build up. These chemicals in small amounts are harmless; it’s the day after day ingestion and build up of them which can lead to degenerative diseases.\nOne common detox diet is the combination of nothing but fruits and water for a given period. The promotion of chemicals being metabolized by our bodies can be helped with certain vitamins, herbs and supplements. Some supplements will help the mobilization of toxins in our fat and other toxin deposits located throughout the body. Since our bodies rid themselves of chemicals through sweat, sauna therapies can also provide a great benefit. There are many other diets and detox therapies, these are just a few common methods. Regular body detoxification is a good preventative action and promotes a healthier present and future!\nAbout The Author...\nRyan S.

    "By Pure Matters\nLike the ringing of an alarm clock, a cluster headache announces itself every morning or night.\nIf you suffer from cluster headaches, you know that timing is everything. These headaches -- called \"cluster\" because of their pattern of striking in groups or clusters -- hit at the same time of day for a period of weeks or months, then vanish as suddenly and as mysteriously as they appeared.\nThe pain of cluster headaches is very intense. Most sufferers cannot sit still and will often pace during an acute attack. Often described as having a burning or piercing quality, the pain may be throbbing or constant. The scalp may be tender.\nCluster headaches, which are generated by swelling of blood vessels in the head, generally reach their full force within five to 10 minutes after onset. The attacks are usually very similar, varying only slightly from one attack to another.\nMalfunction is the trigger\nResearchers now believe that cluster headaches, as well as migraines, are triggered by a malfunction of neurotransmitters --in particular, serotonin-- which control the action of the blood vessels in the head and neck.\nAlthough the pain of a cluster headache starts suddenly, people usually have a bit of warning that one is on the way. That warning is often a feeling of discomfort or a mild, one-sided burning sensation. Most cluster headaches last only 30 to 45 minutes, but some range from a few minutes to several hours. The headache will disappear only to recur later that day; most sufferers get one to four headaches per day during a cluster period.\nBecause they occur so regularly, generally at the same time each day, they have been dubbed \"alarm clock headaches.\"\nThe headache periods can last weeks or months and then disappear completely for months or years. The cluster headache sufferer has pain-free intervals between series. Many cluster headaches occur in the spring or autumn. Because of this, cluster headaches are often mistakenly associated with allergies or business stress. The seasonal relationship is unique for each sufferer. In about 20 percent of cluster sufferers, the attacks may be chronic--they are present throughout the year and do not occur in groups, thus making the control of these headaches more difficult.",

    "The Georges River was an important focal point for Aboriginal life and culture iin the southern Sydney region, offering both food, transport and dreamtime links. Several major language groups existed along the river: Eora to the east, Dharag to the west, north and north-east, Dharawal to the South and Gandangarra in the far south-west.\nThe early 1800s saw European settlers migrating to the areas along the Georges River. Much of the catchment was cleared for farmlands and housing, however the banks stayed relatively untamed due to their rugged slopes.\nDevelopment within the catchment has flourished since WWII. Today, the Georges River and surrounds are a highly significant landscape feature of the Sydney region and the Campbelltown environment.

But what if you have both? About 25 percent of people with diabetes have some level of anemia. This article explains how the two conditions interact.\nWhat Is Anemia, and Why Is It Linked to Diabetes?\nIn anemia, there are fewer red blood cells than normal, resulting in less oxygen being carried to the body's cells. People with anemia often feel tired or weak and may have difficulty getting through activities of daily living. Other symptoms include paleness, poor appetite, dizziness, lightheadedness, rapid heartbeat, and shortness of breath. Because these symptoms can also be associated with diabetes, they are sometimes not recognized as evidence of anemia.\nAnemia may occur with diabetes because the hormone that regulates red blood cell production, erythropoietin (EPO), is produced by the kidneys. Kidney damage at several levels is a complication of diabetes, and one problem often leads to the other. Changes in the kidneys that occur with diabetes range from diabetic nephropathy all the way to chronic kidney disease. Early detection and treatment is essential to prevent or delay disease progression. Information in greater detail can be found at www.kidney.niddk.nih.gov.\nOther causes of anemia are low levels of iron or other vitamins, as well as prolonged illness.\nA simple blood test done during a doctor visit, called a complete blood count or CBC, is used to check for anemia. The two elements of the test that reveal anemia are hemoglobin and hematocrit. Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen to the cells. Hematocrit indicates the percentage of red blood cells in the blood.\nHow Does Anemia Affect Your Diabetes Care?\nIf you have anemia, your blood glucose tests may not be accurate. Studies that looked at blood glucose monitor accuracy found that low hematocrit levels can falsely increase glucose measurements, leading to monitor test results as much as 20 percent too high. Healthcare providers and patients need to be aware of this combination and consider it when responding to glucose levels, especially when treating patients on insulin.\nPatients with anemia should ask their healthcare provider which blood glucose meter might be best for people with both anemia and diabetes. This question is currently being evaluated by the American Diabetes Association and the FDA.\nWhy Does Hematocrit Affect Glucose Monitor Accuracy?\nAll glucose monitors are designed to measure the level of glucose in the blood, but, unfortunately, not all blood is the same. A major difference between blood samples is the percentage of red blood cells, or hematocrit. The average hematocrit for men is slightly higher than the average for women. Young children tend to have a lower hematocrit than adults. As people age, hematocrit values usually are lower.\nLow hematocrit is a common side effect of many illnesses and of drug therapies like metformin. Reductions in kidney function that occur in diabetes can also cause lower hematocrit values.\nHematocrit is part of the calculation that all glucose monitors use for measuring glucose. Monitor companies pick a \"most likely\" hematocrit value for their monitor calculation. If your hematocrit differs significantly from the hematocrit value used by the manufacturer, your monitor test results will be affected. The larger the difference between the manufacturer's hematocrit value and your hematocrit value, the bigger the effect will be on your meter's accuracy. Small changes in hematocrit are not a problem, but as patients move into anemia, the effect on accuracy is larger. Some of the newer meters have hematocrit corrections built in.\nTreatment of Anemia in Diabetes\nIron supplementation is the most common treatment for anemia. When kidney disease is involved, there are additional options that you can discuss with your healthcare provider. If no cause other than reduced erythropoietin (EPO) production is found, anemia can be treated with a genetically engineered form of EPO that is usually injected under the skin two or three times a week. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends that patients treated with EPO therapy achieve a hematocrit between 30 and 36 percent.\nAdjusting your diet to include foods rich in iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 may also be helpful. Ask your diabetes educator or registered dietitian to help you adjust your meal plan to include these nutrients.\nA number of steps can be helpful in preventing anemia. Keep your blood glucose at the target levels set by you and your healthcare provider, and maintain your blood pressure under 130/80. Control your lipids, and work with your healthcare team to manage your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Finally, eat a well-balanced diet that includes foods containing iron.\nEver since the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial in 1993, studies have shown that the largest influence in diabetes care is the person with diabetes. Your participation in your own care is critical, so it's important to be aware of how anemia can affect your diabetes.\nCategories: Anemia, Blood Test, CBC, Chronic Kidney Disease, CKD, Complete Blood Count, Diabetes, Diabetes, FDA, Folic Acid, Food, Glucose Monitor, Glucose Results, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, Insulin, Iron, Iron Supplement, Kidney Disease, Metformin, vitamin B12\n3 comments - Feb 16, 2012\nDiabetes Health is the essential resource for people living with diabetes- both newly diagnosed and experienced as well as the professionals who care for them.

    "In the case of the drapery study above, drawn in graphite while I was in art school, the key light strikes the form from the left. You can tell it’s a hard source because of the sharp diagonal cast shadow line. Overhead fluorescents, only slightly less bright, illuminate the shadow side.\nThe drapery study has the look of an academic exercise partly because it is \"overmodeled\" which means the tendency to put the full range of modeling factors within each passage.\nOutdoors, the blue light from the sky usually modifies the shadow planes, depending on how much they face upward. Reflected light often raises the tone of the shadow. It comes from light bouncing up off the ground surface or from other surfaces. The darkest parts of the shadow are usually at points of contact, called occlusion shadows, where secondary sources can't reach.\nAnother dark part of the shadow is the area just beyond the terminator. This area is called the core or the hump of the shadow. The core of the shadow only forms if the secondary source of light (edge light, reflected light, or fill light) doesn’t overlap too much with the main light.\nIn “Daniel in the Lion’s Den,” by Rubens, a strong orange-colored reflected light fills the shadow side of Daniel’s form, all the way from his cheek and neck, down his arm and his leg. Keeping the core intact—or painting it in even if it’s not really there—can give the form more impact, but if it’s overdone it can look unnatural.\nIf you’re setting up a model or maquette, you can place the primary and secondary lights just far enough apart so that you can see the core beginning to form.\nLight and Form, Part 1\nLight and Form, Part 2\nLight and Form, Part 3\nYou also might be interested in these posts:\nMore about all this in my book: Color and Light: A Guide for the Realist Painter",
    "Battleground for Empire and Independence\nSeptember 29–October 5, 2013\nHistorian Guide: Frank Ackerman\nAt the dawn of the 18th century, French colonies extended from the St. Lawrence River to the Great Lakes. British colonies extended west from the Atlantic seaboard, and both sought to expand into the territory between. After the Treaty of Paris ended French imperial claims in North America, the British Empire found its authority challenged by rebellious American colonists.\nWaterways were then the transportation arteries, and nowhere else in North America are there more 18th-century forts and battlefields than in the Upper Hudson River and Lake Champlain valleys. This corridor, from Albany through Lake Champlain to Canada, witnessed key battles in both the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War. At Fort Ticonderoga, France achieved its greatest victory, repulsing a much larger British army in the bloodiest battle on North American soil until the Civil War. To end rebellion in the American colonies, British General John Burgoyne considered the Lake Champlain-Hudson River Valley \"precisely the route an army ought to take\" to invade New York. He expected to isolate New England and then focus on crushing that seat of discontent. However, the Americans forced Burgoyne's army to surrender at the Battle of Saratoga, a crucial victory that renewed Patriots' hopes, secured essential foreign recognition, and forever changed the face of the world.\nHistorian Frank Ackerman will guide you through the crucible of North American wars for an exciting, in-depth look at independence from an empire.\n7 Days / 6 Nights\nCost: $2,725 Single Occupancy, $2,325 Double Occupancy\nClick to request a 2013 printed Travel Guide.\nSunday, September 29\nGather in Albany, New York for a briefing and welcome dinner hosted by Frank Ackerman and HistoryAmerica TOURS.\nMonday, September 30\nAfter a brief stop at the Phillip Schuyler Mansion, we will board Amtrak's Adirondack for a three-hour trip north from the Hudson River and along the west shore of Lake Champlain.

We detrain at Windsor and tour the house where the Vermont Constitution was adopted in 1777. This was America's first Constitution that prohibited slavery, allowed men to vote without owning property, and created public schools. We continue by motor coach to Charlestown, New Hampshire, where we tour the reconstructed Fort at No. 4. Established in 1740 on land granted by the Royal Governor of Massachusetts, this fort was the northernmost outpost of Britain's New England colonies.\nWednesday, October 2\nWe begin the day by retracing the route of the Crown Point Military Road, started in 1759 by General Jeffery Amherst to connect His Majesty's Fort at Crown Point, New York, with the Fort at No. 4. Later we see reconstructed 18th-century vessels at the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum.

    "An EV’s speed controller is the equivalent of the carburetor or fuel-injection system in an ICE vehicle. To control the vehicle’s speed, the controller takes the energy from the battery pack and feeds it to the motor in a regulated manner. Modern controllers do this by pulse-width modulation, taking the full voltage from the battery pack and feeding it to the motor in thousands of tiny on–off pulses per second. The longer the duration, or “width” of the “on” pulses, the more electricity the motor receives and the faster the vehicle moves. Because the pulses are so tiny, the process feels completely smooth to the driver.\nEVs can have AC motors or DC motors, and each needs its own kind of controller. In EVs with AC motors, an AC controller must first convert the DC from the batteries into AC before feeding it to the motor.\nHow does the controller know how much energy to give the motor? The potbox tells it. This linear potentiometer is a sensor that produces a resistance output proportional to its displacement or position. It responds to the driver’s foot pressure on the throttle pedal and sends a corresponding signal to the controller. The throttle pedal in an EV works just as it does in an ICE vehicle—the more you depress it, the faster you go.\nThe motor is the brawn of the EV, converting electrical energy from the batteries into mechanical energy to propel the vehicle. Instead of invisible electrons flowing through wires, we now have rotating components.\nIt’s the relationship between electricity and magnetism that enables the motor to do work. Passing electricity through a wire creates a magnetic field around the wire. By winding wire in a motor and running electricity through it, magnetic poles that repel each other are created, causing the shaft of the motor to spin.\nIf the EV has regenerative braking, the motor can also act as a generator. When the vehicle is coasting or braking, the momentum of the car drives the motor—rather than the motor driving the car. The magnetic fields induce current in the wires, the flip side of the process described above. The electricity flows backward through the controller (which rectifies it from AC back into DC) and into the battery pack. This process also creates drag on the motor—the “braking” part of regenerative braking, which is very similar to what happens in an ICE car when you lift your foot off the throttle in a low gear. Though it’s an intrinsic part of AC drive systems, regenerative braking is more rare in DC systems, where a special controller and extra wiring are required to allow the motor to serve as a generator.\nThe energy output from the spinning shaft of the motor now needs to reach the drive wheels. On a very small EV, the motor might drive the wheels directly, but with full-size vehicles, at least one level of gear reduction is necessary to reduce the revolutions per minute (rpm) of the motor to a usable speed at the wheels. A “direct-drive” vehicle will have a single gear reduction, which might be a gearbox or a belt-and-pulley arrangement. No shifting is necessary. This is common with AC motors that have upper limits of 8,000 to 13,000 rpm. DC motors with limits of about 5,000 to 6,000 rpm usually use the same kind of multiple-gear manual transmissions found in ICE cars. In EVs with manual transmissions, the clutch is usually retained and works the same as in an ICE vehicle.",
    "Symptoms of Brain Tumor\nAll forms of brain tumor are serious, but if someone is diagnosed with a brain tumor, it is better to have benign brain tumor symptoms, rather than metastatic (cancerous) ones, because that means their particular tumor has not resulted in a cancerous growth. Unlike other symptoms of brain tumor-which include headaches, seizures, weakness, and personality changes-benign brain tumor symptoms are far less serious, considering the other possibilities. These sorts of brain tumors are composed of a smaller group of cells that do not follow the regular kind of cell division and growth patterns. They develop into a mass of cells that do not take on the characteristic appearance of a cancer. They might find out about this benign diagnosis when undergoing a CT or MRI scan. (CT stands for Computerized Tomography, often referred to as a CAT scan, or X-ray procedure, http://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm; MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, which is a radiology procedure that uses a computer to produce images of body structures http://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm.) On the other hand, this kind of tumor should not to be downplayed, but should be treated with extreme care and caution.\nThough a benign brain tumor doesn’t usually develop into something cancerous, it can still happen. If someone has a family history of cancer, they should be diligent about getting frequent to regular medical checkups. The same holds true if they are often exposed to radiation or chemicals, such as formaldehyde.\nThere are numerous symptoms of brain tumor, such as changes in any of the five senses (sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch), a change in how they feel pain, pressure, or temperature, and loss of control over coordination, balance, or bodily functions. Those individuals with symptoms of brain tumor will often have difficulty doing things that used to be simple, such as walking, talking and retaining information from someone when they are speaking.\nBrain tumor symptoms in teenagers are something to be aware of; tumors and cancers are no respecter of age. symptoms of brain tumor in women In fact, brain tumors are more common in young children and older adults than in the ages between. So, though brain tumor symptoms in teenagers may not be any different from the ones that adults experience, it does indicate something important: the symptoms are probably more aggressive than usual. (Since it is far rarer in teens, it should be taken that much more seriously.)\nOther symptoms of brain tumor:\n” Memory loss, confusion\n” Muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg (usually on one side) brain tumors symptoms\n” Changes in alertness\n” Changes in behavior, mood, emotions, personality\n” Eye abnormalities-eyelid drooping, different sized pupils, uncontrollable movements\nIndividuals should not immediately jump to conclusions if they display one or several symptoms of brain tumor, whether these are brain tumor symptoms in teenagers or symptoms in adults. If possible, consult a surgeon or medical doctor who is an expert in this area. There is surgery, treatments and procedures available out there for certain brain tumors. For instance, there is radiation therapy and chemotherapy as well as some procedures that will reduce brain swelling, pressure, and seizures. Pain medication and antacids are available to help deal with some symptoms, too.\nBe sure to refer to several resources when conducting research for yourself or a loved one, symptoms of brain tumors in addition to getting regular medical checkups. Some such resources are as follows:\nPosted in: Basketball - Men",

While there has been much interest in innovative psychosocial support programs that complement PMTCT clinical services, only a few such programs exist, and there is very little data about their effectiveness. Although m2m is a well known program with anecdotal accounts of successfully supporting HIV-positive women, the program had yet to undergo an external evaluation.

TELEPHONE (818) 354-5011\nCONTACT: Jim Doyle\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE November 17, 1995\nSHUTTLE EXPERIMENT STUDYING DROPLETS SUCCESSFUL\nImproved production of future medicines and better recovery of crude oil could result from an instrument that studied the behavior of liquid drops in microgravity on a recent 16-day flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia, according to NASA scientists.\nThe Drop Physics Module-2 (DPM-2), one of 16 experiments aboard the U.S. Microgravity Laboratory-2 that flew on the shuttle last month, uses sound waves to manipulate liquid drops for close study. It enables scientists to test basic theories of fluid physics that cannot be proved on Earth because of gravity.\n\"It gave us very good data, two weeks of data,\" said DPM-2 Project Scientist Arvid Croonquist of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"Now we need to study that data to see what it implies and how it can be applied.\"\nOne of the efforts, he said, may contribute in time to the treatment of some hormonal ailments such as diabetes. One part of the experiment studied a pair of chemicals that could be used to make a protective membrane for living cells to be transplanted into a patient's body as part of hormone therapy. To simulate making the membrane, the scientists employed a substance made of polymers or long molecules, the same material used for soft contact lenses. The experiment's intent was to see the effects of reduced gravity on the bonding of polymers.\nThe second part of the study was to see if there is a force that can be used to place the mass of cells within the membrane. Using a water drop inside an oil drop, the astronaut operators showed that this force is very small. In microgravity fluid processes evolve much more slowly than they would on the ground, and the scientists can study videos of the experiment instead of the high-speed imaging required for ground-based studies, Croonquist said.\nAnother part of the experiment looked at how the surface of water drops interact with different chemicals, called surfactants. They are similar to chemicals used in detergents to help water remove grease or oils from surfaces. Using these experiments to confirm a model developed by DPM-2 scientists, he said, could lead to better ways to mix chemicals with steam to recover additional crude oil from previously pumped fields.\nOther objectives of the experiment were the study of rotating drops splitting into smaller drops and to relate flows in the interior of a drop to the motion of its surface.\nAn acoustic chamber is at the center of the Drop Physics Module-2. Liquids are injected into the chamber and then manipulated with sound waves. An astronaut-scientist controls the experiment via a special computer while video and film cameras record the behavior of the liquid droplets.\nFormer payload specialist Dr. Eugene Trinh, who flew with the DPM-1 in 1992, monitored the data transmission using ground based instruments at the operations center at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL. Principal investigators of the experiment were Dr. Taylor Wang of Vanderbilt University and Dr. Robert Apfel of Yale University.\nDPM-2 was built by Loral Electro-Optical Systems, Inc. The experimental work aboard the shuttle was done under contract to NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Science and Applications.\n\"Much of the mission success should be attributed to the hard work of the JPL/Loral team in preparing for the mission,\" said DPM-2 Manager David Gallagher.",

    "An acoustic guitar is a guitar that uses only an acoustic sound board to help transmitting the strings' vibrational energy to the air in order to produce a sound.\nThe initial timbre and harmonics of the sound in an acoustic guitar are produced by the plucking of the string. The frequencies produced depend on string length, mass, and tension. The soundboard will add various resonant modes due to its own mix of bracing, damping, and undamped resonance.\nThe acoustic guitar is a hollow body and an additional coupling and resonance effect increases the efficiency of energy transmission in lower frequencies. The air in a guitar's cavity resonates with the vibrational modes of the string and soundboard. At low frequencies, which depend on the size of the box, the chamber acts like a Helmholtz resonator, increasing or decreasing the volume of the sound again depending on whether the air in the box is moving in phase or out of phase with the strings. When in phase, the sound is increased by about 3 decibels and when in opposing phase, it is decreased about 3 decibels. As a Helmholtz resonator, the air at the opening is vibrating in or out of phase with the air in the box and in or out of phase with the strings. These resonance interactions attenuate or amplify the sound at different frequencies, boosting or damping various harmonic tones. Ultimately, the cavity air vibrations couple to the outside air through the sound hole (some variants of the acoustic guitar omit this hole, or have holes, like a violin family instrument). This coupling is most efficient because here the impedance matching is perfect: it is air pushing air.\nThere are therefore several sound coupling modes in an acoustic guitar: string to soundboard, soundboard to cavity air, and both soundboard and cavity air, to outside air. The back of the guitar will also vibrate to a lesser extent, driven by the air in the cavity. The function of the entire acoustic system is twofold: to color the sound through the generation and amplification of harmonics, and to maximize the coupling of this energy to the surrounding air - which is ultimately what we perceive as loudness of the produced sound. Improved coupling, however, comes at the expense of decay time, since now the string's energy is more efficiently transmitted. An unamplified guitar (one with no soundboard at all) would have a low volume, but the strings would vibrate much longer, like a tuning fork.\nAll these complex air coupling interactions, along with the resonant properties of the panels themselves, are a key reason that different guitars will have different tonal qualities. The sound is a complex mixture of harmonics that give the guitar its distinctive sound.\nThis section contains all acoustic guitars including 12-string, western, electro, folk and parlour.",
    "Properties and Benefits of Rapeseed Honey: Rapeseed honey is a special variety of monofloral honey made from the flower nectar and pollen of rapeseed (Brassica napus). This particular variety has a few unique characteristics, such as a fast crystallization time and a sweet-peppery flavor. It’s most renowned for its ulcer-treating properties, but has other therapeutic effects as well such as antibacterial and antioxidant effects, mild immunostimulating properties, a tonic action as well as other digestive benefits. In order to enjoy its beneficial action, the honey has to be raw and unprocessed.\nWhat is rapeseed? Rapeseed is a crop grown primarily for oil production and is related to mustard and cabbage, from where it draws some of its more unusual properties. The plant is also called canola and the resulting oil canola oil (or rapeseed oil). The oil obtained from the seeds of the plant is a rich source of Omega-9 fatty acids in the form of eruci acid. This form however has been shown to be harmful for the heart muscle, hence the reason why edible rapeseed oil is bound to have less than 5% erucic acid. The plant species is also a wonderful source of flower nectar, allowing for the production of an interesting and aromatic honey variety.\nWhat is rapeseed honey? Rapeseed is a monofloral (unifloral) honey, meaning it is produced mostly from the nectar and, incidentally, pollen of rapeseed flowers, but may contain limited amounts of other sources of nectar and pollen as well (clover, for example). The beautiful, vivid yellow flowers are the source of a peppery-tasting honey with a surprisingly fast crystallization time. Because rapeseed flowers also contain pollen which is more or less incidentally added to honey, the resulting honey can cause allergic reactions in individuals already allergic to rapeseed pollen. If you are allergic to honey bees (the enzymes they secrete to make honey, their sting), then you are most likely allergic to everything they produce, from honey to propolis, royal jelly, bee bread, beeswax etc.\nWhat does rapeseed honey look like? The variety has an interesting appearance: while the flowers serving as a source of nectar are a beautiful, vivid yellow, the resulting honey has a very light and dull beige-yellow pigment. The color can be described as a whitish yellow or a milky yellow. Since the honey can crystallize even before being harvested, it is not liquid, but soft-solid in texture. Its consistency is given by the fine crystals it forms. Typically, rapeseed honey crystallizes in 3 to 4 weeks.\nWhat does rapeseed honey smell and taste like? The smell of the honey is reminiscent of that of rapeseed flowers, somewhat oily, subtly heavy like a vegetal oil, but faintly floral nonetheless. The honey has a medium taste intensity, with a moderately-low sweetness, but nevertheless sugary (due to its texture) and with an original flavor profile. Perceived flavor notes may include: faint cabbage notes, slight mustard or peppery aftertaste, but pleasant tasting. If processed to be made liquid, soft-creamy or to alter its taste, it may not retain its original taste, color or therapeutic properties. Also, the honey can ferment over time and in improper storage conditions, potentially becoming sour.\nGood to know. Not all rapeseed planted for oil or honey production is organic. Much of the crops throughout North America are genetically modified to resist various pests or pesticides and have currently been introduced to Europe too. So check the origin and label of your honey to see if it’s organic or genetically modified.\nWhat is rapeseed honey good for? The variety is said to boast numerous therapeutic uses, from offering digestive relief to promoting nervous system relaxation and improving various symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections in particular. Here are 6 wonderful proposed health benefits of rapeseed honey:\n1) Natural remedy for gastritis and stomach ulcer. Rapeseed honey has been traditionally recommended for the management and treatment of both gastritis and stomach ulcers. Both the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory elements in the honey and its consistency are believed to encourage the healing of the stomach lining and soothe irritation, hence the supposed effectiveness. The natural sugars in the honey boast mild prebiotic properties, helping feed the good bacteria in our intestines, contributing to an overall better digestion. Other honey varieties like acacia, manuka or forest honeys are eaten raw on an empty stomach in the morning for digestive relief as well.\n2) Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory action. Rapeseed honey is known to possess mild natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Its action is primarily local, hence the reason why it can help in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections like colds or flu and help improve their symptoms. Studies show a preparation of rapeseed honey with a 40% concentration can efficiently inhibit the growth of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, while royal jelly together with rapeseed honey are even more efficient (Reduction Effect of Royal Jelly and Rape Honey Alone and in Combination Against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Strains). The pollen in rapeseed honey also has mild immuno-modulating effects, stimulating the immune system response.\n3) Calms cough and soothes a sore throat. Eating raw rapeseed honey can help reduce sore throat discomfort and possibly calm cough due to the honey’s natural antibacterial and soothing properties. It is recommended to avoid eating and drinking anything for about an hour after taking honey to allow it to exert its action.\n4) Source of vitamins and minerals. Research shows that although rapeseed honey has a lower nutrient content than other honeys, it does contain a wide variety of essential nutrients, particularly dietary minerals such as potassium, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium as well as smaller amounts of zinc and sodium (Determination of trace elements in rape honey and its corresponding rape flower and stem). Heating the honey can cause the nutrients in it to deteriorate, especially vitamin C.\n5) Natural tonic action. Like all honey types, rapeseed too is energizing and great for preventing low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) and fatigue. In addition to natural sugars, the variety contains small amounts of all sorts of nutrients, from vitamins and dietary minerals to pollen particles, antioxidant compounds and other elements, all of which contribute to its tonic effect.\n6) Good for uneven skin and acne. Light-colored honeys can be used as a natural face mask for uneven skin tone. Rapeseed is an especially good natural exfoliator due to its consistency and can help unclog pores, reduce sebum and clean the face of impurities, potentially helping reduce acne breakouts (if used consistently). The variety may hold other skin benefits as well, such as calm irritation or make skin brighter, more radiant.\nOther supposed health benefits. Rapeseed honey is said to exert a hepatoprotective action, helping maintain liver health and, indirectly, detoxify the body of toxins. It is also believed to possess mild sedative, relaxing or sleep-encouraging properties by regulating the activity of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Certain enzymes in the honey are believed to be good for bone health and osteoporosis. However, such benefits have yet to be confirmed.\nConclusion. Rapeseed honey is an original-tasting variety, suited to many uses. Its most prized therapeutic properties include a natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory action, cough relief, eliminating sore throat discomfort, tonic properties as well as gastritis and stomach ulcer management. But irrespective of the individual action of the honey, for it to have any therapeutic effect or preserve its unique taste profile, it has to be raw, unheated and unprocessed in any way.",

Originally two families occupied these log cottages with two rooms, each family had their own room. From Egerton Ryerson, “THE STORY OF MY LIFE”, ed. J. George Hodgins\n(Toronto: William Briggs, 1883), page 59.\nPeter Jones was born in 1802, the son of Augustus Jones, a retired surveyor, of Welsh background, born and raised in what is now New York State. Peter’s mother was Tuhbenahneequay (Sarah Henry), a daughter of Wahbanosay, the Mississauga (Ojibwe) chief at the Head of the Lake (present-day Hamilton). Peter grew up with his mother’s people in an Ojibwe world to the age of fourteen. He later spent the next seven years with his father learning English and how to farm.\nPortraits (miniature; oil) of Peter Jones : painted by Matilda Jones in London, England, in 1832. Portrait housed at Victoria University Library (Toronto)\nAfter his conversion to Christianity in 1823 the bilingual and bicultural Mississauga become a Methodist church worker with Ojibwe people of the Great Lakes. He worked to help them become Christian farmers. With his brother John he completed several of the earliest translations of the Bible into Ojibwe. He was elected a chief of the Mississaugas of the Credit.\nThe last known image of Peter Jones, sketched probably in the early 1850s. The illustration appears as the frontispiece in his LIFE AND JOURNALS OF KAH-KE-WA-QUON-NA-BY (Rev. Peter Jones), Wesleyan Missionary (Toronto: Published by Anson Green in the Wesleyan Printing Establishment, 1860)\nTo raise money for the Methodist missions in Upper Canada, as Ontario was then known, he made three fund-raising tours of Britain. He met his future wife, Eliza Field, on the first. They married in 1833. She became his lifelong ally. As a chief he defended First Nations land rights, and worked to obtain a full and equal partnership between the First Nations and non-Aboriginal settlers. His Life and Journals (1860) and History of the Ojebway Indians (1861) were published posthumously, after his death in 1856.",
    "How many times did you hear that today? Probably a lot. But why are adults so hung up on hand washing? Why are they so in love with lather?\nWashing your hands is the best way to stop germs from spreading. Think about all of the things that you touched today — from the telephone to the toilet. Maybe you blew your nose in a tissue and then went outside to dig around the dirt.\nWhatever you did today, you came into contact with germs. It's easy for a germ on your hand to end up in your mouth. Think about how many foods you eat with your hands.\nYou can't wear rubber gloves all day long, but you can wash your hands so those germs don't get a chance to make you or someone else sick. When germs go down the drain, they can't make anyone sick.\nSo when are the best times to wash your hands?\nwhen your hands are dirty\nbefore eating or touching food (like if you're helping cook or bake, for example)\nbefore and after visiting a sick relative or friend\nNow you have the when and the why of hand washing. But did you know that a lot of people don't know how to get their paws perfectly clean? The next time you're told to step up to the sink and scrub up, remember these handy hints:\nUse warm water (not cold or hot) when you wash your hands.\nUse whatever soap you like. Some soaps come in cool shapes and colors or smell nice, but whatever kind gets you scrubbing is the kind you should use. Antibacterial soaps are OK to use, but regular soap works fine.\nWork up some lather on both sides of your hands, your wrists, and between your fingers. Don't forget to wash around your nails. This is one place germs like to hide. Wash for about 10 to 15 seconds — about how long it takes to sing \"Happy Birthday.\" (Sing it quickly two times or just once if you go nice and slow.)",
    "Francis Cottington, 1st Baron Cottington\nHe was the fourth son of Philip Cottington of Godmanston in Somersetshire. According to Hoare, his mother was Jane, daughter of Thomas Biflete, but according to Clarendon, \"a Stafford nearly allied to Sir Edward Stafford\", through whom he was recommended to Sir Charles Cornwallis, ambassador to the court of Philip III of Spain, becoming a member of his suite and acting as English agent on the latter's recall, from 1609 to 1611.\nIn 1612 he was appointed English consul at Seville. Returning to England, he was made a clerk of the council in September 1613. His Spanish experience rendered him useful to King James, and his bias in favour of Spain was always marked. He seems to have promoted the Spanish policy from the first, and pressed on Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, conde de Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, the proposal for the Spanish in opposition to the French marriage for Prince Charles (later King Charles I).\nAfter his return he was appointed secretary to Prince Charles in October 1622, and was knighted and made a baronet in 1623. He strongly disapproved of the prince's expedition to Spain, as an adventure likely to upset the whole policy of marriage and alliance, but was overruled and chosen to accompany him. His opposition greatly incensed George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and still more his perseverance in the Spanish policy after the failure of the expedition, and on Charles I's accession Cottington was through his means dismissed from all his employments and forbidden to appear at court. The duke's assassination, however, enabled him to return.\nHe was a Roman Catholic at least at heart, becoming a member of that communion in 1623, returning to Protestantism, and again declaring himself a Roman Catholic in 1636, and supporting the cause of the Roman Catholics in England. On 12 November 1628 he was made a privy councillor, and in March 1629 appointed chancellor of the exchequer. In the autumn he was again sent as ambassador to Spain; he signed the peace treaty of 5 November 1630 and subsequently a secret agreement arranging for the partition of the Dutch Republic between Spain and England in return for the restoration of the Palatinate. On 10 July 1631 he was created Baron Cottington of Hanworth in Middlesex.\nIn March 1635 he was appointed master of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and his exactions in this office added greatly to the unpopularity of the government. He was also appointed a commissioner for the Treasury, together with William Laud, and a fierce rivalry sprang up between the two men. However, in their personal encounters Cottington nearly always had the advantage, because he practised great reserve and possessed great powers of self-command, an extraordinary talent for dissembling, and a fund of humour. Laud completely lacked these qualities, and although really possessing much greater influence with Charles, he was often embarrassed and sometimes exposed to ridicule by his opponent.\nThe aim of Cottington's ambition was the place of lord treasurer, but Laud finally triumphed and secured it for his own nominee, Bishop Juxon, when Cottington became \"no more a leader but meddled with his particular duties only.\" He continued, however, to take a large share in public business and served on the committees for foreign, Irish, and Scottish affairs. In the last, appointed in July 1638, he supported the war, and in May 1640, after the dismissal of the Short Parliament, he declared it his opinion that at such a crisis the king might levy money without the Parliament. His attempts to get funds from the City of London were unsuccessful, and he had recourse instead to a speculation in pepper.\nHe had been appointed constable of the Tower, and he now prepared the fortress for a siege. In the trial of Strafford in 1641, Cottington denied on oath that he had heard him use the incriminating words about \"reducing this kingdom\". When the parliamentary opposition became too strong to be any longer defied, Cottington, as one of those who had chiefly incurred their hostility, hastened to retire from the administration, giving up the court of wards in May 1641 and the chancellorship of the exchequer in January 1642. He rejoined the king in 1643, took part in the proceedings of the Oxford Parliament, and was made lord treasurer on 3 October 1643. He signed the surrender of Oxford in July 1646, and being excepted from the indemnity retired abroad.\nHe joined Prince Charles at the Hague in 1648, and became one of his counsellors. In 1649, together with Edward Hyde, Cottington went on a mission to Spain to obtain help for the royal cause, having an interview with Cardinal Mazarin at Paris on the way. They met, however, with an extremely ill reception, and Cottington found he had completely lost his popularity at the Spanish court, one cause being his shortcomings and waverings in the matter of religion. He now announced his intention of remaining in Spain and of keeping faithful to Roman Catholicism, and took up his residence at Valladolid, where he was maintained by the Jesuits. He died there on 19 June 1652, his body being subsequently buried in Westminster Abbey.\nHe had amassed a large fortune and built two magnificent houses at Hanworth near Heathrow and Fonthill near Tisbury, Salisbury. Cottington was evidently a man of considerable ability, but the foreign policy he pursued was opposed to the national interests and futile in itself. According to Clarendon's verdict \"he left behind him a greater esteem of his parts than love of his person.\" He married in 1623 Anne, a daughter of Sir William Meredith and the widow of Sir Robert Brett. All his children predeceased him, and his title became extinct at his death.\n- Chisholm 1911.\n- Hunneyball, Paul. \"COTTINGTON, Sir Francis, 1st Bt.

    "MYSTIC, Conn. (AP) — Oceanographer Robert Ballard, best known for discovering the Titanic wreck, has new plans to plumb the depths of the seas.\nBallard said Thursday that his latest deep-sea venture will send crews combing through the Black, Aegean and Mediterranean seas for artifacts from ship wrecks and ancient civilizations.\nHis research vesse set out from a port in Turkey last week on a four-month mission that will use four remote-operated vehicles and sonar technology to explore lost cities.\nAt a news conference, Ballard said that while he has a general idea what his crew might find, the exploration is about looking for the unknown.\n\"We're fascinated by extremely confusing parts of our planet and we say 'let's go there and see if we can figure it out,' \" said Ballard.\nThe 211-foot ship, carrying a team of about 15 scientists, will travel through waters including the Hellenic and Aeolian Arcs, the Gorringe bank and the Straits of Sicily — a course that will take it near deep trenches, continental faults and cities under the surface of the Mediterranean that are more than 2,000 years old. The journey is expected to wrap up in November off the coast of Israel.\nBallard, who is also a professor at the University of Rhode Island, founded the Institute for Exploration at the Sea Research Foundation, the nonprofit environmental organization that also runs Mystic Aquarium. In addition to leading an international team that discovered the RMS Titanic in 1985 on the floor of the North Atlantic, Ballard found the wrecks of the battleship Bismarck and the PT-109 torpedo patrol boat that John F. Kennedy commanded during World War II.\nThe 69-year-old explorer said his ship will dispatch video and audio feeds from this newest venture to connect with the public as he pursues new discoveries. The material will be available online and at a theater at Mystic Aquarium, and teams of educators will rotate aboard the ship to host information sessions and explain the latest finds.\nMission co-leader Katherine Croff Bell said the live technology lets the ship expand beyond the knowledge of the scientists onboard.\n\"If we don't have the proper expertise on the ship we can call somebody on shore and have them be a part of the exploration in real time,\" Bell said.\nPaul Johnson, an oceanographer at the University of Washington who has worked with Ballard, said these types of expeditions help stir public interest in deep-sea research. He said the voyage was not a traditional research mission and would likely involve a mixture of education, entertainment and \"probably some science mixed in there.\"\nThe ship's primary mission is to make discoveries, not try to extract artifacts or disturb the seabed. For Ballard and the E/V Nautilus, that means setting themselves up for to find something new by planning trips over unusual or unknown areas.\n\"What really excites me is when you go looking for one thing and find something more important,\" Ballard said.\n\"So we are all about creating moments of discovery by trying to get a little lucky,\" he said.\nOn the Web:\nE/V Nautilus website: http://nautiluslive.org/",
    "Seven miles to the south west of Sheffield there's a piece of wild moorland surrounded by roads. It's called Big Moor. I estimate that if you circumnavigated it on foot by the boundary roads it would take you over seven hours. In spite of its wild appearance, Big Moor was once home to generations of neolithic people. They built at least three significant stone circles, several cairns, dwelling houses and field systems. This was in days when there were still wolves in the British Isles, long before the Romans introduced rabbits and horse chestnut trees and in a time when there were no horses or wheat or potatoes. Life must have been very hard.\nBy the middle ages, the stone circle builders had gone but the country had very few roads and most travel was still on foot. Trading tracks began to criss-cross the land and on Big Moor several stone posts or stoops were erected to guide travellers and traders across the difficult terrain with its bogs and dips, rivulets and hardy moorland vegetation. Mick Jagger's surname harks back to the jaggers of yesteryear - hardy men who carried heavy packs - they were pedlars and hawkers. The verb \"to jag\" meant to pack or to carry. When good roads were built and roadworthy coaches developed, the jaggers disappeared but their paths and their guideposts were left behind.\nIn the nineteenth century, as the importance of clean, reliable water supplies became more obvious, many reservoirs were constructed across England and on Big Moor you can see the location of Barbrook Reservoir which is now disused.\n|Barbrook II stone circle|\n|Highland cattle avoiding the hot British sunshine|\n|One of the remote guideposts on Big Moor|\n|Another one - taller, more weathered|\n|Perhaps an old cross in the middle of the moor - not marked on maps|",

    "The key to successful weight loss could be a matter of simply going for a walk, according to new research which has extolled the benefits of an after-dinner stroll.\nAccording to experts at the Joslin Diabetes Center, a type of fat in the body known as brown fat – which is known to burn calories – is activated when it is cold.\nThis process is accelerated when the temperature is very low and people begin to shiver in order to generate heat – something that would occur if we were to venture into the open air after dinner and take a stroll.\nDr Aaron Cypess, who led the research, suggested that this could help people to lose weight by burning calories, without any side-effects.\nHe explained: “Mild cold exposure stimulates (brown fat) energy expenditure with fewer other systemic effects, suggesting that cold activates specific sympathetic pathways.\n“Agents that mimic cold activation of brown fat could provide a promising approach to treating obesity while minimising systemic effects.”\nAnother option could be the creation of new cooling vests which would help people to lose weight without even having to venture outside, it was suggested.\nDo you ever have a walk after dinner?",

    "Fashion Designers use math 90% of the time they design. They use geometry, counting for inventory, pricing, costs, value, and proportions. Calculations and measurements are used daily by designers.\nThey use many of the concepts we have learned this year. They have to find angles to sew at, percents when discounting, amount to spend and charge for a profit, set up proportions to know what to re-order when doing inventory, and they use tessellations when designing patterns.\nThis is enough to provide for a future family. The family would have to be small, but the more experience you get as a fashion designer the higher your salary is.\nTechnology impacts this career in many ways. The designers can make 3D images online to see what the designs look like on models. They can sell their designs to customers on the internet to make money twice as fast. The most important thing designers use technology for is manufacturing.\nFuture technology will help this career majorly. Technology is only improving and it will help sell products more efficiently. Someday it will allow the buyer to try on the item digitally so they can see what it looks like on them before they buy it.\nOther occupations that are related to this career are interior design and jewelry designing.\nWhat we found most interesting about this job is how much variety they get to work with. There are endless amounts of fabrics, thread colors, and textures. They also have a lot of freedom with what they make. There is no exact instruction to make a shirt. They make it a little different every time and add their own personal style.\nWe only knew a few things about how this job is related to math. We had never thought about different angles to sew at or cutting out different shapes.\nWe would like all the freedom from this job and being able to put our own fashion style on the products. We would dislike the fear that our products wouldn't sell and getting fired at a moments notice. Since you put your own style sense into the product, not everybody would like it.",
    "Studies of a thigh bone fossil have uncovered strong evidence that a human-like creature walked upright six million years ago rather than the widely accepted four million years ago.\nWalking on two feet, bipedalism, is one of the characteristics that distinguishes apes from humans.\n‘Dating the beginnings of bipedalism is very important in the human story,' said Chris Stringer, human evolution expert at the Natural History Museum. 'Because, for many experts, it would mark a clear divergence from the ancestral/ape pattern and show that the human lineage had really begun.'\n‘Bipedalism probably does represent a fundamental first step in human evolution,’ Stringer said. ‘As Darwin recognised, walking on two legs frees up the arms and hands for tasks like carrying, tool making, and tool use. And much of what happened in human evolution later on stemmed from it.’\nCT (Computed tomography) scans were carried out on the fossil thigh bone and the density patterns of the bone were much closer to a modern human than to an ape.\nReported on the National Geographic website, Robert Eckhardt, who lead the research team at Pennsylvania State University, said ‘In present-day chimps and gorillas, the thicknesses in the upper and lower parts of that bone are approximately equal. In modern humans, the bone on top is thinner than on the bottom by a ratio of one to four or more.’ The ratio in the fossil was one to three, showing a bone formation more in line for an upright walker.\nEckhardt and the research team report their findings in the journal Science.",
    "May 24, 2013\nAn insulinoma is a tumor in the pancreas that produces too much insulin.\nBack to TopAlternative Names\nInsuloma; Islet cell adenoma\nBack to TopCauses\nThe pancreas is an organ in the abdomen. The pancreas makes several enzymes and hormones, including the hormone insulin. Insulin's job is to reduce the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood by helping it move into cells.\nMost of the time when your blood sugar level drops too low, the pancreas stops making insulin until your blood sugar returns to normal. Tumors of the pancreas that produce too much insulin are called insulinomas. Insulinomas keep making insulin, even when your blood sugar drops too low.\nA high blood insulin level causes a low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia). Hypoglycemia may be mild, leading to symptoms such as anxiety and hunger. Or it can be severe, leading to seizures, coma, and even death.\nInsulinomas are rare tumors. They usually occur as single, small tumors in adults.\nThese tumors are very rare in children. Most children with high blood insulin levels have many areas of overactive insulin-releasing cells in the pancreas, instead of a single tumor.\nMore than 90% of insulinomas are non-cancerous (benign) tumors. People with the genetic syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type I are at risk of insulinomas and other endocrine tumors.\nBack to TopExams and Tests\nAfter fasting, your blood may be tested for:\n- Blood C-peptide level\n- Blood glucose level\n- Blood insulin level\n- Drugs that cause the pancreas to release insulin\nBack to TopTreatment\nSurgery is the recommended treatment for insulinoma. The tumor is first found by tests or surgery. Medication may be used to get patients stable before surgery.\nIf there is a single tumor, it will be removed. If there are many tumors, part of the pancreas will need to be removed (partial pancreatectomy). At least 15% of the pancreas must be left to produce its enzymes for digestion. This may prevent the surgeon from removing the whole insulinoma tumor.\nIn rare cases, the entire pancreas is removed if there are many insulinomas or they continue to come back. Removing the entire pancreas leads to diabetes because there is no longer any insulin being produced. Insulin injections are then required.\nIf no tumor is found during surgery, or if you are not a candidate for surgery, you may get the drug diazoxide to lower insulin production and prevent hypoglycemia. A diuretic (water pill) is given with this medication to prevent the body from retaining fluid. Octreotide is used to reduce insulin release in some patients.\nBack to TopOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn most cases, the tumor is non-cancerous (benign), and surgery can cure the disease. But a severe hypoglycemic reaction or the spread of a cancerous tumor to other organs can be life-threatening.\nBack to TopPossible Complications\n- Severe hypoglycemic reaction\n- Spreading of a cancerous tumor (metastasis)\n- Diabetes if the entire pancreas is removed (rare)\nBack to TopWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your health care provider if you develop any symptoms of insulinoma.

    "Based upon the historical bandit Song Jiang and his companions, this Chinese equivalent of the English classic Robin Hood and His Merry Men is an epic tale of rebellion against tyranny and has been thrilling and inspiring readers for hundreds of years.\nThis edition of the classic J. H. Jackson translation features a new preface and introduction by Edwin Lowe, which gives the history of the book and puts the story into perspective for modern readers. First translated into English by Pearl S. Buck in 1933 as All Men Are Brothers, the original edition of the J.H. Jackson translation appeared under the title The Water Margin in 1937. In this updated edition, Edwin Lowe addresses many of the shortcomings found in the original J.H. Jackson translation, and replaces the original grit and flavor of Shuihui Zhuan found in Chinese versions, including the sexual seduction, explicit descriptions of brutality and barbarity, and the profane voices of the thieving, scheming, drinking, fighting, pimping lower classes of Song Dynasty China. Similarly, the Chinese deities, Bodhisattvas, gods and demons have reclaimed their true names, as has the lecherous, over-sexed and ill-fated Ximen Qing. All of which was sanitized out when first published in 1937. While Chinese in origin, the themes of The Water Margin are universal enough that it has served as a source of inspiration for numerous movies, television shows and video games up to the present day.\n[AMAZONPRODUCTS asin=\"0804840954\"]Enter your email address to subscribe to China-underground and receive notifications of new posts by email.",
    "What Should We Do to Make Learning More Efficient?\nI’d like to talk about 3 aspects of knowledge: span, depth and connections between the disciplines. I’ve come up with a good metaphor to bring these aspects together, and it looks very to the point. Though, I don’t like metaphors that much, as they’re misleading quite often.\nBasically, my metaphor stems from another metaphor according to which people can be broken down into two types. The first type is someone who likes to go over many things in their learning and research. The people of the second type pick just one or two disciplines and dig into them. The first type are foxes, the second type are hedgehogs.\nTo me, learning looks very much like a geological field research. Imagine that you’re facing a new mysterious continent. You know nothing about it. Of course, you can see mountains, forests, rivers but you have no idea of what’s in there. You don’t know what’s over the horizon, is there a sea, how cold this continent is on the north and what’s the temperature in the south.\nSo, you start putting the map together. You send expeditions everywhere and you sketch the local maps. Then you drill surface holes to identify the soul texture and composition. Then you discover oil, gold, diamonds, and you start mining.\nLearning follows exactly the same scenario. Let’s say you’re studying maths. In the beginning you know very little about it. Okay, you count to 10, and you see how three red balls are different from five blue balls. Step by step you’re discovering some new territories. You learn multiplication tables, and you’re amazed as you get to know the real numbers, or as you find out that it’s impossible to divide by zero. You briefly touch upon differential calculus, and for some unknown reason you learn how to take integrals. By the time you’re 16, you’ve got the map of the nearby territories on your hands, but most likely you have no idea of the set theory, topology and functional analysis. It’s very unlikely that you’ve acquired in-depth knowledge in any of the fields in mathematics. Just scooped and scratched the tidbits off of the surface.\nHigh school doesn’t provide solid knowledge. You only sketch your map at school as you get ready to drill the surface holes.\nChoosing your field can be easy … or difficult. One way or another, there you are at a university. Your teachers rightly assume that you know nothing. The truth is: most of the teachers don’t really care where you start your drilling. They deliver their lectures in a boring or in a fun way, and they rarely put any emphasis on the connections between disciplines. Take physicists: they grab differential calculus and use it to solve their problems. No one cares to trace mathematical analysis to physics and to check if it can be used there. Any given scientific field is an island on your map. For some reason, the common belief states that it’s your job to build bridges between the islands – or at least to set up a ferry service.\nYour map abounds in the white patches of seas and oceans that can hardly be drilled, except for the shelf areas.\nThe islands of knowledge build up clusters as they become one integral whole for you, and instead of the bridge an archipelago emerges. That’s the time when you lay down the foundation for cross-field connections. As these connections take shape, the archipelago transforms into a solid land, good enough to host a highway. For example, you’ve got this distinct knowledge of what derivatives are, and how they can be applied to mechanics. Bang, there you go, now you definitely see a connection between the motion of bodies and differential calculus.\nWhy differential calculus is a standalone subject in the school curriculum? Why no one ever says how it can be applied to solving practical tasks?\nThe contemporary education, at least in this country, does help if you’re set to discover and develop the new islands… but not the new continents. Too little attention is paid to the connections, as well as to the paths and the logic of discoveries. That’s too bad.\nFoxes and Hedgehogs\nBack to knowledge span vs. knowledge depth. When you set out to some new field, it’s better to put together a map first, that is, to acquire a span of knowledge. That’s the only way to be able to dig deep into the subject later and identify the spots for drilling.\nYou must be a fox first, to be able to shape-shift into a hedgehog later. That’s the problem of today’s world: it’s much easier to end up being a fox forever, than to become a hedgehog. I feel it myself; it’s a lot harder to get deep down into your chosen field of knowledge. You always want to read just one more blog post, check Twitter, take a look at this interesting article or book. When all the world’s information is at your fingertips, it’s soo tempting to be a fox.\nThe spot is selected, and the drill sharpened. So, how to drill now? Watch out for interesting soil layers and horizons. If you reach those layers, you’d never roll back. Beware the space in between the layers – that’s where the rocks might crumble. You dig deep into the subject, you read, you do something, and there’s a moment when things fall into place. Congrats! You’ve found the gold.\nThere’s one more good metaphor, I’ve picked it up in some book. In the beginning you find yourself in the dark room, and you’re using touch and feel to discover what’s in this room. Then there’s an instant, when the lights turn on, and you see very clearly what is where. The same is going on in your head. The light is suddenly on, and all the standalone concepts get precisely aligned. You will never forget that moment, and this clear alignment will always be there. The lights will be on at all times. The overhead lights might dim with time, but they won’t go out completely.\nAt times it’s very hard to make yourself keep on drilling. When you see that nothing changes, and you’ve been pecking this subject for several months with no evident progress, you just want to give up everything and get away to some sunny beach. What are you supposed to do in this case? The answer is the same – keep on doing it. If you give up once, give up twice – you’d lose your self-confidence, that’s it. You’d obsess over the thought that you’re good for nothing and get stuck at your current layer forever. You have to keep on drilling. You have to get to the first precious layer and experience the “aha!” moment. You have to turn on the lights to see what’s in the room.\nWhat’s the difference between brilliant programmers and average programmers? It might well be about just one thing: with brilliant programmers, this faith is there all along. They just believe they can’t be anything else but brilliant programmers, whereas average programmers never conjure such things and give up on the drilling eventually. The power of faith and self-confidence can work wonders.\nWhat if you don’t like the drilling location that you’ve previously selected? You have to get busy with something else then. If you take no delight in the studies, if you unconsciously register the count of pages in a new book the moment you open it – this subject or this discipline is not for you. Go over your map one more time and find another location. Maybe you’d get interested in UX, or automation, or marketing. With one or two trial drillings you will locate the spots worth putting your effort into.\nSo, how we learn? What should we do to make the learning process more efficient?\n- Turn on “the fox mode” and sketch your map. Identify some starting points for a more in-depth look into the subject.\n- Try to make sense of the connections between disciplines and order the studies logically. It’s quite easy on the high-level.\n- Turn on “the hedgehog mode” and dig deep. You’ll have to interrupt the focused digging though to jump to the related subjects, otherwise you won’t be able to reach the even deeper layers.\nA great teacher would disclose his map to the students, guiding their way and showing implicit connections between the disciplines. Students will never lose their way if they have such a map.\nUnfortunately, I haven’t come across a teacher who would have done that to his students. So I have to break through the jungle all by myself, working with my machete and carrying my torch, as I put new territories on the map. Hopefully, my children will have better luck.\nP.S.

    "The Moon alphabet was invented by Dr. William Moon (1818-1894). Dr Moon lost his sight completely at the age of 21 after being partially sighted throughout his childhood. He learnt all the embossed reading systems available at the time but found them unsatisfactory so invented his own system. He brought out his first booklet in the new alphabet, 'The Last Days of Polycarp', in 1847.\nNews of Dr Moon's new alphabet spread quickly and he was soon swamped with requests for parts of Bible. At first Dr Moon printed all the documents at his home in Queens Road, Brighton, UK. In 1856 however, he managed to obtain funding from the blind philanthropist Sir Charles Lowther to set up a printing press and workshop nearby. The Moon Printing Works operated on the same premises until 1960, producing books and magazines in 471 different languages.\nDr Moon also travelled to many parts of the British Isles and other parts of the world setting up printing presses, libraries and home teaching socities. After his death in 1894, his daughter Adelaide continued his work.\nToday Moon's alphabet is little used or known outside the UK. Since the 1990s though there has been a revival of interest in it.\nFurther information about William Moon and the Moon alphabet\nAn introduction to the Moon alphabet\nHosted by Kualo",
    "I hope not to get in trouble for posting, verbatim and with minimal commentary, an update we’ve just received from Eliot’s kindergarten. I find this fascinating and, in its way, rather utopian:\nAs you know, we have been experimenting in our room with different kinds of learning supports for our classroom, such as “wiggle spots” to sit on, headphones for quieter concentration, and “private offices.” Many of the kids seem to have high oral needs right now, so we introduced two “chew tools” this week — chewy straws and gum. The gum is all natural, no chemical sweeteners, and sugar free (sweetened with xylitol). We will continue to supply straws as needed as well as chewy snacks at choice time. The gum seems to work better than the straws and be more hygenic as it does not touch hands or other surfaces once it is in the mouth.\nA need to chew on pencils, clothing or hair is a common kindergarten behavior, and providing alternate chewing experiences can help focus and concentration as well as be relaxing for kids. However, gum is not a choice for all families, so if you would prefer that your child not use this chew tool, please let me know.\nThis is different from the kindergarten of memory.",

Local patterns vary but the sharks often head toward the Poles in summer and return to the Equator in winter on sea voyages that have been known to top 2,000 nautical miles.\nDespite their wanderlust, adult female dusky sharks are homebodies when it comes to reproduction. These animals give birth in the same continental regions where they were born. This natal site fidelity means that dusky sharks around the globe live in distinct populations that are not replenished by wandering or migrating animals. Such local pride has a downside, however, because the isolated communities are more susceptible to localized overfishing pressures.\nThis threat has materialized into a serious danger in the western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Studies suggest that population numbers in this region are only 15 to 20 percent of their mid-1970s levels. Commercial and recreational fishing for these sharks in the western Atlantic and Gulf was banned in 2000 but they are often accidentally caught on longlines and other fishing gear—with high mortality rates. Elsewhere the dusky shark is still targeted for trade in shark fin soup, with devastating results. The shark fin trade is difficult to quantify but recent studies have suggested as many as 750,000 dusky sharks could be caught in the trade each year.\nDusky sharks are extremely long-lived and may survive up to half a century, but they are slow to grow and to reproduce. The sharks don't reach sexual maturity until about 20 years of age. Dusky sharks may have a gestation period of up to 22 months, so females only give birth once every three years. The young sharks, some 6 to 12 per litter, congregate at inshore nursery areas along the coasts of South Africa, the southeast United States, and southwest Australia.\nView photos of the world's largest freshwater fish fighting for survival, as pollution, overfishing, and construction threaten the rivers and lakes they call home.\nExplore and discover the world's oceans like never before with facts, photos, news, video, and more!\nSee close-ups of great white sharks lurking, hunting, and attacking.

    "Respondents to the 2004 ARC incubator survey were asked several questions related to the finances of their programs. One question pertained to their overall operating budget, while other questions focused on the level and source of operating subsidies.\nThe average (mean) annual operating budget for an Appalachian incubator is just less than $290,000. In comparison, the average annual operating budget among respondents to NBIA's 2002 State of the Incubation Industry study was about $365,000. The range of annual operating budgets in the 2004 ARC survey is dramatic; it goes from a low of $15,000 to a high of $1.7 million.\nTo be consistent with the exclusion of five large incubators from the earlier calculation of the average-sized Appalachian incubator, a similar analysis was prepared that excluded the operating budgets from the same set of incubators. This yielded an average Appalachian incubator annual operating budget of just less than $273,000.\nA final, and perhaps more useful, analysis was completed that excluded the responses from incubators whose annual budgets were either two standard deviations greater or less than the mean. This process removed the incubators with the five largest budgets. The resulting average operating budget came to slightly more than $219,000 for the group, with a range of $15,000 to $761,000.\nAs illustrated in Table 8, it appears that Appalachian incubators have considerably smaller operating budgets than do incubators nationally. Some of the difference might be explained by a lower cost of living in Appalachia relative to the nation as a whole. However, it is believed that at least part of the difference indicates that Appalachian incubators are less likely to generate operating revenues to cover their operating budgets. This theory can be tested by reviewing the 2004 ARC survey responses regarding operating subsidies, below.\nSurvey respondents were asked three questions relative to subsidization of their programs:\nFigure 11. Financial Status of Appalachian Incubators\nFigure 12. Percentage of Self-Sustaining Appalachian Incubator Budgets from Outside Sources\nAfter eliminating those incubators that are self-sustaining (20 percent) and self-sufficient (28 percent), the remaining 52 percent of Appalachian incubators require an insecure source of funding to maintain operations. The responses of these incubators that are neither self-sufficient nor self-sustaining indicate that, on average, they receive a subsidy of 53 percent of their operating budget from unreliable external sources (see Figure 13).\nFigure 13. Percentage of Budget from Unreliable Sources in Appalachian Incubators That Are Not Self-Sufficient or Self-Sustaining\nBoth good and bad news can be derived from the analysis of these results. First the good news:\nNow the bad news:\nSimply put, about half of Appalachian incubators are at risk of closure because of their heavy dependence on unreliable funding sources. While one might argue that this is an overstatement of the situation, since the 53 percent represents an average subsidy requirement of these non-self-sustaining, non-self-sufficient incubators, Figure 14 paints a clearer picture of the problem by showing the range of subsidies as a percentage of an incubator's budget. The data suggest that perhaps 10 of these at-risk incubators are in the survivability range (requiring a subsidy of 25 percent or less), while another 27 are at greater risk, with subsidy requirements ranging from 26 percent to 100 percent of their operating budgets. It is also worth noting that anecdotal evidence suggests that incubator managers can be unrealistically optimistic about the stability and longevity of certain governmental funding sources.\nFigure 14. Percent of Budget from Subsidy\nAnother potential source of the operational funding difficulties was identified when respondents provided information about the structure of their rental rates. Figure 15 shows that 57 percent of respondents said their rental rates were below market, while only 5 percent indicated that they had above-market rates. It is difficult, if not impossible, for a business incubator to achieve financial self-sustainability, much less self-sufficiency, if it does not charge at least market rate for the space that it leases.\nFigure 15.

    "Daylight Saving Time 2012: When Do We Set the Clocks Back?\n\"Spring forward, fall back,\" is the mantra you need to remember on Nov 4.\nDaylight Saving Time ends on Sunday, Nov. 4, at 2 a.m., right before the Presidential election on Nov. 6.\nYou will be setting your clock back one hour, following the adage of “spring forward, fall back.” The “extra” hour gives you a chance to catch up on the sleep you lost in March when the clocks moved forward and Daylight Saving Time began.\nThe federal government doesn’t require states to adopt Daylight Saving Time, so Arizona doesn’t. Indiana used to ignore Daylight Savings, but now observes it. Indiana is the only state, however, with counties in two time zones. Ones snuggled up close to Lake Michigan and Chicago are on Central Time, but the rest of the state is on Eastern Standard Time.\nIn an effort to save resources during World War II, the U.S. made daylight saving time mandatory for the whole country. And it was observed the entire year.\nSome studies have shown that extending Daylight Saving Time results in a reduction in energy consumption; other studies suggest just the opposite.",
    "This blog is the last of a four-part series highlighting themes from “\nThe Last Mile in Ending Extreme Poverty\na book published this month by Brookings Institution Press.\nIndia today is already richer than Germany was when it introduced social insurance for all workers in the late 1880s. Indonesia is richer than the United States was in 1935, when the Social Security Act was passed. And China is richer than Britain was in 1948, when the National Health Service was introduced. So what can we learn from comparing developing countries today to richer countries when those countries were at equivalent levels of economic development?\nAlthough the industrial revolution had dramatic effects on poverty in today’s rich countries, the end of extreme poverty only occurred in those countries after the creation of modern welfare states in the post-World War II period. These welfare programs raised the living standards of the most destitute citizens while establishing a “social floor” that protected all members of society.\nToday’s lower and middle-income countries, despite their significant progress, are actually lagging behind in their fight against poverty when compared to countries that industrialized before the 20th century. In Table 1, I’ve compared the extreme poverty rates of today’s developing countries—China, India, Indonesia, and Nigeria—to the extreme poverty rates of today’s rich countries—the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, France, Japan, Italy, and Spain—when those countries were similarly “developing.”\nTable 1. Extreme poverty rates of today’s rich countries, when they were at similar levels of development (%)\nNote: table compares extreme poverty rates in the four countries across the first row (2010 data, in parentheses) to those of the seven advanced, industrialized countries in the first column in the approximate year in which the per capita incomes of the matched countries were approximately equal. All rates represent the percentage of the population living below $1.25 per day in 2005 PPP-adjusted dollars. Per capita incomes used to match country pairs are also in constant 2005 PPP-adjusted dollars. Poverty rates are generated from parameterized Lorenz curves based on data from François Bourguignon and Christian Morrisson (2002), “Inequality Among World Citizens: 1820-1992,” American Economic Review 92, 4: 727-744.\nTake India, for example. In 2010, India’s extreme poverty rate stood at 33 percent, and its per capita income was just above $3,000. The U.K., U.S., and Germany passed the $3,000 per capita mark in 1870s, 1890s, and early 1900s, respectively. Their extreme poverty rates in those decades were 12 percent, 10 percent, and 5 percent, respectively. A similar gap can be seen when comparing India with France, Japan, and Italy, all of which had extreme poverty rates at or below 15 percent when they were at the $3,000 per capita mark. Even Spain, which did not cross the $3,000 mark until the late 1950s, kept extreme poverty to less than half the Indian rate at the time.\nOne explanation—that today’s rich countries grew more “inclusively” a century ago than developing countries today—cannot be the whole story. In the first place, there is considerable variation in income inequality across low and middle-income countries. Moreover, as described by everyone from Charles Dickens to Karl Marx to Thomas Piketty, the beginnings of industrialization plunged large numbers of landless working people throughout Europe into (mostly urban) poverty. And just as today’s richer countries were transitioning from lower to upper-middle income countries, they were also experiencing peak inequities—during the “Gilded Age,” when private wealth exceeded national income and was concentrated among a small group of wealth-holders. Yet all of these countries managed to eliminate extreme poverty within a few decades.\nThe gap in reducing poverty is more likely due to very different trajectories of social protection. The earliest social protection programs in Western Europe were of the contributory variety—financed out of taxes on wages—as a way of preventing social conflict. Otto von Bismarck’s pension, sickness insurance, and worker compensation programs were, after all, created to pre-empt a Social Democratic victory in Germany. These systems, combined with the political changes taking place in the continent, would lead to dramatic expansions in social protection in later decades. Even as industrialization initially caused poverty, it also created rising wages for workers. Eventually, organized working classes formed a strong alliance with the fast-growing, urban middle class. This political coalition sought policies that would protect itself from economic cycles—especially after the economic turmoil of the 1920s and 1930s—that would eventually result in the postwar welfare system. Indeed, the durability of these welfare programs may be attributed to the participation of the middle class, which shaped program design: welfare programs provided universal coverage so that the middle class itself was not excluded from benefits.\nMany of today’s developing countries have followed a very different path. Labor tends to be less organized and have weaker relative bargaining strength. Much of the labor force remains in the informal sector and is left out of any contributory schemes, which tend to have limited scope. Social protection is more reliant on a fragmented system consisting of a large number of non-contributory programs financed out of general revenues. More importantly, the preferences of both governments and donors are mainly for programs that target particular sub-populations to achieve cost efficiency.\nConsequently, an opposite political dynamic appears to be playing out in developing countries. Instead of middle class “buy-in” resulting in broader and more comprehensive programs, targeted and fragmented programs are inhibiting median-voter support for social protection and leading to middle-class exit. The consequences are familiar to designers of targeted social protection—their vulnerability to shifts in political winds, their susceptibility to abuse or capture by elites, and their occasional failure to outlive the aid programs that may finance them.\nThe overall result is that the demand for comprehensive welfare programs in middle-income countries remains weak.\nOf course, this may be changing as countries such as India begin to recognize the political as well as economic benefit of programs in which all citizens have a stake. Indeed, the Modi government has unveiled a universal social security program in its latest budget, perhaps recognizing that the last mile in poverty reduction is more likely to be achieved and sustained through social policies that garner broader political support by including the nonpoor as beneficiaries.",
    "Web server (Apache)\nFrom Oxxus Wiki\nWeb server, Apache, is an Open Source server application and can be installed from the source or appropriate distro's package.\nWith Apache, by default, comes PHP interpreter, which has to be installed separately if installation is done from the source. If it's done with automatic packages, it'll pull it for installation automatically.\nInstructions on installation from packages is detailed below.\nFor Ubuntu/Debian OS, Apache comes as deb package and can be installed either using dpkk installer, which requires deb package, or by apt-get, automatic installer.\nFor RedHat related, like Centos, RedHat ES or Fedora, rpm installer can be used for installation, which again requires rpm package, or yum, automatic updater/installer.\nIn either case, once Apache is installed, you're ready to configure it for default s and start it up to serve your web pages. Apache comes with default configuration file which needs minor settings to be able to serve web pages. Configuration file is at Apache's configuration folder and is named httpd.conf, regardless which OS distribution is used.\nSeveral required settings for Quick-Start-Up\nFirst, ServerName directive needs proper name, or Apache will assume that there is no name assigned to web server and will start as localhost service. ServerName directive always uses domain's name which web pages are to be served.\nPort directive tells which TCP port will be used for this service, commonly it's 80 because every browser is going to send request to port 80 in order to access web pages served by server.\nIf set to any other port, you'll have to do the redirection from 80 to custom port.\nWith these directives your web server is ready to serve your web site pages.\nAll web site related files have to be placed into Apache main web folder. By default, this is /var/www/html/ for RedHat related, or /var/www/ for Debian related OS.\nMain web folder, if not used one from default configuration, can be set in Apache's configuration file with directive DocumentRoot \"\"\nBy default, Apache queries for index.html or index.php which are standard index pages, depending if pages are written in PHP or in plain HTML This one can be set to custom value with directive DirectoryIndex Default Character Code set is not defined, but if you need special characters or Foreign Language support for your pages, then you can set it up with directive AddDefaultCharset\nAnother interesting feature of Apache service is having aliases. This feature allows serving pages from by files that are not in main web folder but are placed anywhere in server. Setting is pretty straight-forward. Place Alias directive like follows.\nAlias /test/ “/var/www/test/”. With this example Apache will serve pages defined in files from folder /var/www/test/\nYou can restrict accessing entire folders, and subfolder, and any contents within by setting.htaccess feature\nIn Apache configuration file, set the directive AllowOverride All and here are files that has to be placed into desired folder. Apache will automatically vring up this service once it finds.htaccess.\n.htaccess file (place it into desired folder)\nAuthName ZoneName AuthType Basic AuthUserFile FOLDER_FOR_PROTECTION/.htpasswd Require valid-user\nIf you have access to shell prompt of apache's server then use commands below in order to generate.htpasswd file with users and passwords allowed\nhtpasswd -nbm USENAME PASSWORD >>.htpasswd\nExecute this command from shell prompt and at folder where.htpasswd is defined to at.htaccess file\nAll these directives are allowed for global web server configuration, set to serve pages from default web folder. But they can be set for specific folders as well. This is enabled by directive Directory, set as follows, in example\n<Directory /FOLDER_NAME>...options and directives set here are strictly for this FOLDER_NAME and files server from it </Directory>\nServe contents for multiple domains\nWith Apache application server, you can also serve contents for multiple domains, separately. This feature is called Virtual Hosting and basic settings for test.com is as follows.\nNameVirtualHost *:80 (required for Apache to set to serve multiple domains) <VirtualHost *:80> DocumentRoot FOLDER_WHERE_WEB_FILES_ARE_STORED ServerName test.com ServerAlias www.test.com ErrorLog logs/test.com-error_log CustomLog logs/test.com-access_log common </VirtualHost>\nWith configuration set as above and web files placed into FOLDER_WHERE_WEB_FILES_ARE_STORED, you can restart Apache and access web site contents of www.test.com By configuring virtual domains as shown, you can serve as many domains as you need.\nApache's configuration file contains detailed how-to instructions for all directives and options that are required for your web site to work correctly.",
    "Wild Cherry Bark\nFrom Natural WellBeing\nWild Cherry Bark\nCherry trees are popular because of their beauty especially when at their fullest bloom. But only a few people know of the cherry tree's significant contributions to both ancient and contemporary medicine.\nOrigin and History\nThe cherry tree is a huge, deciduous plant with a rough bark and dark green pointy leaves. It is characterized by tiny but still showy white flowers during spring. Its fruits are, of course, the staple of many homes - the small and round fruits with colors ranging from the reddest red to the darkest purple.\nMost people think that the cherry tree originated from North America since it is present in large groves in many areas of the United States and Canada. The truth, however, is that the cherry tree is a native of Asian countries like Japan but was only imported to North America and Europe.\nIn ancient times, the cherry tree served many functions including symbolic, aesthetic and medicinal values. Buddhists believe that the cherry tree symbolized virginity and purity although it was also associated with fertility, which explains its strong association with the health of pregnant women. Other symbolic meanings included education and disguises.\nIts medicinal values were mainly for lung disorders. Ancient peoples used the bark of the cherry tree to treat a wide variety of ailments. Cherokees used it to ease the pains of childbirth, the Mohegans treated dysentery with it and the Meskwakis used it as a sedative.\nOther effective uses for the bark of the cherry tree are as an anti-tussive and anti-asthma. The tea from its bark was used to treat Coughs and to expel mucus from the lungs. Such is its efficacy in these respects that the cherry tree was included in the Pharmacopoeia list of the United States from 1820 to 1975, thus, proving the anecdotal evidence suggested by the Native Americans.\nOf course, the cherry tree was also valued for its beautiful appearance and its delicious fruits. With such a wide variety of uses, it's no wonder that man is attracted to the tree.\nIn modern times, the cherry tree still has a good reputation as the source of effective herbal medicine. Herbal supplements that come in the form of teas and capsules have been developed with the cherry tree as the main component for the treatment of similar ailments as in ancient times. Many herbal supplements also boast of cherry tree as a secondary ingredient because of its antiseptic properties.\nIn Germany and Mexico, the cherry tree is also being studied for its anti-cancer properties. Although the study itself is highly controversial, the initial results appear to be promising. For now, we suggest taking fresh cherries and taking in cherry supplements to take advantage of its rich antioxidant content.\nOf course, cherry trees are also popular choices for furniture pieces because of their durability, beauty and easy availability. Cherries can also be eaten raw or enjoyed as jams, candies, syrups and even wine the whole year-round.\nLike most supplements, certain precautions must be made when using cherry tree supplements. First, children less than two years of age must not take any cherry-related medications like herbal preparations. Second, pregnant women and lactating mothers must avoid taking cherry supplements, too. Third, even in relatively healthy individuals, care must be taken so that big doses can be avoided. Take note that the entire tree is composed of hydrocyanic acid, which can be poisonous in large amounts.\nThe wild cherry tree bark is, indeed, very useful in the field of medicine. Its contributions to herbal medicine and in other fields of human interest are worth noting.",
    "Chandra finds largest galaxy cluster in early universeJanuary 10th, 2012 in Space & Earth / Astronomy\nComposite image of the El Gordo galaxy cluster. (X-ray: NASA/CXC/Rutgers/J. Hughes et al; Optical: ESO/VLT & SOAR/Rutgers/F. Menanteau; IR: NASA/JPL/Rutgers/F. Menanteau )\n(PhysOrg.com) -- An exceptional galaxy cluster, the largest seen in the distant universe, has been found using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the National Science Foundation-funded Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in Chile.\nOfficially known as ACT-CL J0102-4915, the galaxy cluster has been nicknamed \"El Gordo\" (\"the big one\" or \"the fat one\" in Spanish) by the researchers who discovered it. The name, in a nod to the Chilean connection, describes just one of the remarkable qualities of the cluster, which is located more than seven billion light years from Earth. This large distance means that it is being observed at a young age.\n\"This cluster is the most massive, the hottest, and gives off the most X-rays of any known cluster at this distance or beyond,\" said Felipe Menanteau of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., who led the study.\nGalaxy clusters, the largest objects in the universe that are held together by gravity, form through the merger of smaller groups or sub-clusters of galaxies. Because the formation process depends on the amount of dark matter and dark energy in the universe, clusters can be used to study these mysterious phenomena.\nDark matter is material that can be inferred to exist through its gravitational effects, but does not emit and absorb detectable amounts of light. Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all space and exerts a negative pressure that causes the universe to expand at an ever-increasing rate.\n\"Gigantic galaxy clusters like this are just what we were aiming to find,\" said team member Jack Hughes, also of Rutgers. \"We want to see if we understand how these extreme objects form using the best models of cosmology that are currently available.\"\nAlthough a cluster of El Gordo's size and distance is extremely rare, it is likely that its formation can be understood in terms of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology. In this model, the universe is composed predominantly of dark matter and dark energy, and began with a Big Bang about 13.7 billion years ago.\nThe team of scientists found El Gordo using ACT thanks to the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. In this phenomenon, photons in the cosmic microwave background interact with electrons in the hot gas that pervades these enormous galaxy clusters. The photons acquire energy from this interaction, which distorts the signal from the microwave background in the direction of the clusters. The magnitude of this distortion depends on the density and temperature of the hot electrons and the physical size of the cluster.\nX-ray data from Chandra and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, an 8-meter optical observatory in Chile, show that El Gordo is, in fact, the site of two galaxy clusters running into one another at several million miles per hour. This and other characteristics make El Gordo akin to the well-known object called the Bullet Cluster, which is located almost 4 billion light years closer to Earth.\nAs with the Bullet Cluster, there is evidence that normal matter, mainly composed of hot, X-ray bright gas, has been wrenched apart from the dark matter in El Gordo. The hot gas in each cluster was slowed down by the collision, but the dark matter was not.\n\"This is the first time we've found a system like the Bullet Cluster at such a large distance,\" said Cristobal Sifon of Pontificia Universidad de Catolica de Chile (PUC) in Santiago. \"It's like the expression says: if you want to understand where you're going, you have to know where you've been.\"\nThese results on El Gordo are being announced at the 219th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin, Texas. A paper describing these results has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.\nMore information: These results on El Gordo are being announced on 10 January 2012 at the 219th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin, Texas.

    "Tel: 01752 660427 Email:firstname.lastname@example.org Bramley Rd, Laira, Plymouth, PL3 6BP\nYear 2 Forest School – Week 1 – September 2015\nWith the new Forest School procedures now in place the Year 2 children made their inaugural trips of the term. This would see two groups go on alternating weeks for the first seven weeks. The idea is to build upon the things they learn to help them recall and make use of these skills in years to come, especially as they go on up to KS2 and have more sessions in the woods in Y6. As Mr Blake’s Forest School work is assessed and passed back by his assessors, a handbook about what we do in Forest School will soon be available to view on the website.\nDuring the first weeks the groups made adventure sticks! These were not any old sticks though, we talked about which sticks we could use so as not to irreparably harm trees. We used loppers (having a good tool talk beforehand) to cut the branches from some overgrown Sycamore specimens we know of and then used secateurs to trim them carefully. The children then had the opportunity to search their area of woodland to find things to tie onto their stick, be it a pine cone, a fern frond, an interesting leaf or a beech nut husk. This made each and every stick individual and many of the children showed great skill and perseverance to independently attach the items using either string or other means. Some sticks were hidden in the woodland den and others ended up making a den!\nWe finished the first session by showing the children how to put up the large shelter in case of bad weather. We talked about how it was good practice to put it up every session to become familiar with the knots needed and so that if and when we did need it ( and we almost certainly will!), we could get it up fast!\nOverall it was a great first week for both groups of the Year 2 children, they showed a fantastic level of responsibility and maturity using the tools and long may that continue into the coming weeks.",
    "Midnight Rising: John Brown & the Raid that Sparked the Civil War\nNovember 2, 2011\nAbolitionist John Brown is best known for his foiled attempt to seize the federal armory and arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, on October 16th 1859. Three years after he and his sons raided and viciously killed five men at a pro-slavery settlement in Kansas, Brown led 18 men, including five blacks and two of his sons, to what is now Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Ten of the men were killed in the raid, one got away, and seven were hanged, including Brown. Our guest, Pulitzer-prize winning journalist TONY HORWITZ, considers if Brown’s intention was to be a martyr for his vehement anti-slavery war stance, as he deepened and exposed the divide between the North and the South and forced people to take sides. In his new book, Midnight Rising: John Brown and the Raid that Sparked the Civil War, he researches the beginnings of Brown’s Calvinist, anti-slavery family and ponders the question whether John Brown's legacy is as a hero or a zealous vigilante.",
    "Medical billing and medical coding go hand in hand, and are often performed by the same professionals. But although they work together as vital pieces in the business of health care, they are distinct professions with their own responsibilities.\nMedical Coding: Translation\nMedical coding is the process of using specific codes to identify medical procedures and services for billing and reimbursement by the patients’ insurance companies.\nA medical coder reads the patient’s medical file — including medical history, current diagnosis, medicine prescribed and services performed — and assigns the appropriate code based on their coding knowledge. The codes are entered into the computer and are universally recognized by other health care professionals to accurately reflect the patient’s case. (See: medical coder job description.)\nMedical Billing: Correspondence\nOnce the procedure and service codes are determined, the medical biller transmits the claim to the insurance company for payment. Medical billing is the process of submitting and following up on claims to insurance companies in order to receive payment for services rendered by a health care provider.\nA medical biller ensures that the patient and health insurance company are properly billed for all procedures. Approved claims are reimbursed, while rejected claims are researched and amended. (See: medical biller job description.)\nSince they work so closely, billers are also familiar with the medical codes that coders use in their job, and in smaller offices the same person may fill both functions.",
    "The most common and most important greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Black carbon is also a potent warmer, although not a greenhouse gas.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2)\nThis greenhouse gas is present in relatively low concentrations in the atmosphere; prior to the Industrial Revolution, it made up about 0.03 percent of the atmosphere. Despite its low levels, CO2 makes up about 30 percent of the greenhouse gases naturally found in the atmosphere and it is the major driver of climate change.\nThere are currently approximately 3 trillion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere; this is 37 percent higher than the level prior to the Industrial Revolution. In the late 1800s, levels of carbon dioxide were 280 parts per million (ppm). Current concentrations are around 380 ppm. Scientists warn that if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes above 450 ppm, the Earth's climate could spiral out of control.\nNatural sources of carbon dioxide include rotting plant and animal matter, forest fires and volcanoes. The major human sources of CO2 are from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) and from deforestation. Scientists attribute the increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to these human sources.\nMethane is a very strong greenhouse gas. Over 100 years, a ton of methane would heat the globe 23 times more than 1 ton of carbon dioxide would. The atmosphere has a methane concentration of 1,774 parts per billion (ppb). This is a 59 percent increase from the methane concentration prior to the Industrial Revolution.\nThere is, however, around 220 times less methane than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, so overall carbon dioxide has a far greater effect in the atmosphere.\nMethane is created by the decay of organic matter. Large amounts come from landfills, cattle and the rest of the livestock sector (chicken and pigs) in general.\nMethane hydrates, a frozen combination of methane and water, are found in vast quantities on the sea floor. It is possible that continued climate change could release these frozen stores of methane and cause a sudden, very large addition of methane to the atmosphere. This would massively magnify the greenhouse effect, causing global warming to reach unprecedented levels.\nNitrous Oxide (N2O)\nNitrous oxide has a global warming effect roughly 300 times that of carbon dioxide over 100 years. However, like methane, nitrous oxide exists in much lower concentrations than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide concentrations in the atmosphere are currently 319 ppb, 18 percent higher than what they were prior to the Industrial Revolution.\nNitrous oxide is emitted by bacteria in soil. Agriculture and the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers, along with the handling of animal waste, increase the production of nitrous oxides. Industries, such as the nylon industry, and the burning of fossil fuels in internal combustion engines also release nitrous oxide into the atmosphere.\nBlack carbon (BC)\nBlack carbon, or soot, is not an actual greenhouse gas, as it is a solid, and warms the atmosphere differently to a gas. However, it has a significant warming effect on the atmosphere.\nBlack carbon is made up of microscopic particles that result from the incomplete burning of organic matter, especially fossil fuels. Black carbon warms both in the atmosphere and when deposited on lighter surfaces, like snow and ice.\nBlack carbon may be responsible for as much as 25 percent of observed global warming. The overall contribution of black carbon to global warming may be substantial, perhaps second only to that of carbon dioxide.\nBecause it can accelerate the melting of snow and ice, black carbon may play a particularly important role in Arctic climate change. Black carbon may be responsible for over 30 percent of Arctic warming. Because the Arctic has warmed at around twice the rate of the rest of the world over the last 100 years, controlling and reducing black carbon emissions is particularly important.",
    "The use of living species to help infer or constrain specific characters in an extinct species is not a new thing, but Professor Larry Witmer gave this a name in 1995...the Extant Phylogenetic Bracket or EPB for short. Larry gave a name to something we already used, and in doing so penned a paper that will continue to receive citations (references within other published works) that will help it rocket into inter-steller levels of fame. Its hard to pick up a book or read a paper on dinosaurs without seeing EPB (Witmer, 1995) being quoted...even Larry agrees this is a rather useful paper in his career.\n|Basic family tree of the dinosaurs and birds....often subject to change!|\nIn many cases we find additional evidence, such as the scars of muscle attachment on fossil dinosaur bones, that show that the EPB data appear to be appropriate (or not as the case may be). Combining such evidence and EPB with a liberal application of comparative anatomy (back to my dissection fun at Penn!), we can build a theoretical understanding of the complete prehistoric animal, as it was with its soft tissues intact. While evidence supports certain aspects of such extrapolation, in other respects this work is necessarily speculative...something palaeontology is often accused of with wagging fingers (and quite rightly so sometimes). About many points concerning soft tissues, we are completely in the dark. The best known dinosaur enigma is their colour, which is a particularly ephemeral aspect of an animal due to the nature of biological pigmentation and the tendency for such pigments to be lost in the fossilization process...but the Manchester team is hot on the trail of this particular conundrum (more on this later I hope!).\n|Amber can often trap beasties, providing excellent preservation |\nenvironments...sadly not big enough for dinosaurs!\nFossilization is a rare phenomenon that occurs to only a tiny fraction of a community’s population of any given place and period, and to none at all in many cases....we are dealing with disjointed sentences of once vast volumes. Nonetheless, if we consider the fossilization of skeletal elements as the standard, then the fossilization of soft-tissue structures is much rarer still. When these unique discoveries are made, this type of fossilization literally “fleshes out” our understanding of the fossil record in many crucial ways. Even a single example of soft-tissue preservation can be of tremendous value in the interpretation of fossil animal types. In each case, special circumstances prevented the ordinary loss of soft tissues. The explanations for certain of these situations have been reconstructed with a high degree of confidence, while the reasons for other localities’ exceptional preservation remain a mystery.\n|Dissection of crocs and birds can often tell us much |\nabout their relatives, the dinosaurs.\nIf your into the preservation of soft tissue, you might want to track down a paper that the Manchester team published last year (Manning et al 2009) in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series B.

    "There's nothing worse than the sound of someone snoring if you're trying to fall asleep. Or maybe it's you who snores, and people tease you about the noise you make in your sleep.\nSnoring isn't just noisy. Sometimes it's a sign of a serious medical problem that should be treated by a doctor. Read on to find out more about the snore!\nSnoozing or Snoring?\nSnoring is a fairly common problem that can happen to anyone — young or old. Snoring happens when a person can't move air freely through his or her nose and mouth during sleep. That annoying sound is caused by certain structures in the mouth and throat — the tongue, upper throat, soft palate (say: pa-lut), uvula (say: yoo-vyuh-luh), as well as big tonsils and adenoids — vibrating against each other.\nPeople usually find out they snore from the people who live with them. Kids may find out they snore from a brother or sister or from a friend who sleeps over. Snoring keeps other people awake and probably doesn't let the snoring person get top quality rest, either.\nPeople snore for many reasons. Here are some of the most common:\nSeasonal allergies can make some people's noses stuffy and cause them to snore.\nBlocked nasal passages or airways (due to a cold or sinus infection) can cause a rattling snore.\nA deviated septum (say: dee-vee-ate-ed sep-tum), which is the tissue and cartilage that separates the two nostrils in your nose, may be crooked. Some people with a very deviated septum have surgery to straighten it out. This also helps them breathe better — not just stop snoring.\nEnlarged or swollen tonsils or adenoids may cause a person to snore. Tonsils and adenoids (adenoids are glands located inside of your head, near the inner parts of your nasal passages) help trap harmful bacteria, but they can become very big and swollen all of the time. Many kids who snore have this problem.\nDrinking alcohol can relax the tongue and throat muscles too much, which partially blocks air movement as someone is breathing and can contribute to snoring noises.\nBeing overweight can cause narrowing of the air passages. Many people who are very overweight snore.\nSnoring is also one symptom of a serious sleep disorder known as sleep apnea. When a person has sleep apnea, his or her breathing is irregular during sleep. Typically, someone with sleep apnea will actually stop breathing for short amounts of time 30 to 300 times a night! It can be a big problem if the person doesn't get enough oxygen.\nPeople with this disorder often wake up with bad headaches and feel exhausted all day long. They may be very drowsy and have difficulty staying awake while having a conversation or even while driving. Kids affected by sleep apnea may be irritable and have difficulty concentrating, particularly in school and with homework.\nAccording to the government's patent office (this is where you go to register an idea or invention), there are hundreds of anti-snoring devices on the market. Some of them startle you awake when they sense you are snoring. Unfortunately, they may only work because they keep you awake!\nThose small, white strips some football players wear across their noses that kind of look like a bandage are another anti-snoring device. Football players wear them during the game to breathe easier while running a play or making a tackle. People also wear these breathing strips to try to stop snoring.\nOther snoring solutions include tilting the top of a bed upward a few inches, changing sleeping positions (from the back to a side), and not eating a heavy meal (or for an adult, not drinking alcohol) before bedtime. These kinds of \"cures\" may work only for someone who snores occasionally and lightly — or they may not work at all.\nIf you can't stop snoring or the snoring becomes heavy, it's a good idea to see a doctor. He or she might tell you how to keep your nasal passages clear and will check your tonsils and adenoids to be sure they aren't enlarged and don't have to be removed.\nSome people need to lose weight, change their diets, or develop regular sleeping patterns to stop snoring. It may be helpful to remove allergy triggers (stuffed animals, pets, and feather/down pillows and comforters) from the person's bedroom. The doctor might also suggest medications for allergies or congestion due to a cold.\nIf a doctor thinks someone has sleep apnea, he or she will order a test to monitor the patient during sleep. This is usually done in a sleep center (a medical building that has equipment to monitor breathing during sleep). A patient is attached to machines that check heart rate, oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, eye movement, chest wall movement, and the flow of air through the nose.\nThe doctor can then tell if a patient has a disorder like sleep apnea. The best thing about the test is that it doesn't hurt at all. After all, you sleep right through it! Once doctors know what's wrong, you can be treated for it, usually with lifestyle changes, sometimes medicines, or even surgery, if necessary.\nSolving a snoring problem lets everyone breathe and sleep a little easier!",
    "Owens Findlay-area Campus Presents Free ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ Film Screening and Discussion, Feb. 19\nFINDLAY, Ohio – Area residents are invited to explore diversity and its societal impact in the 1930s as Owens Community College Findlay-area Campus’ Office of Student Activities and Honors Program presents a free screening and discussion of the film “To Kill a Mockingbird” on Tuesday, Feb. 19.\nThe film, which is being presented in conjunction with the College’s celebration of Black History Month, will be shown at 11 a.m. in the College’s Education Center Room 111 on the Findlay-area Campus. Owens is located on Bright Road in Findlay. Admission to the event is free and the public is encouraged to attend.\nBased on Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, “To Kill a Mockingbird” provides insight into the life of Atticus Finch, who serves as a lawyer in a racially-divided Alabama town in the 1930s. Racial tension escalates as Finch chooses to defend Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. The story is told through the eyes of Finch’s six-year-old daughter Scout and her older brother Jem. “To Kill a Mockingbird” garnered international acclaim highlighted by three Oscar Awards in 1963. The film was directed by Robert Mulligan.\nImmediately following the film, Owens Assistant Professor of Social and Behavioral Sciences Dr. Marian Moore and Interim Chair of English Ellen Sorg will offer insight into the historical and ethical significance of “To Kill a Mockingbird” as part of an open discussion.\nFor more information about the event, call (567) 429-3029 or 1-800-GO-OWENS, Ext. 3029.",
    "The video is a bit outdated, from 2010, and states that many different kind of animals can be Service Animals, including monkeys, THIS IS NO LONGER TRUE.\nAs of March 2011, when the ADA was revised, only dogs and some miniature horses are allowed as Service Animals.\nAnother important note that people need to be aware of is that THERAPY dogs are NOT the same as a SERVICE DOG. Therapy dogs DO NOT have the same public access rights as Service Dogs do. Therapy Dogs are sometimes allowed into hospitals, care facilities, etc to visit the elderly, sick and possibly dying, in order to help lift their spirits, and bring smiles, as well as provide some much needed comfort and therapy to someone who might live alone and suffer with depression or anxiety. There is MUCH benefit to patients of all walks of life when they visit with Therapy Dogs. However, a Therapy Dog is very different than a Service Dog.\nA Service Dog has been specially trained to perform certain individual TASKS to assist the disabled handler, for example, picking things up that have dropped to the floor, opening doors/closing doors, alerting to sights or sounds, etc. Because Service Dogs are specially trained and perform tasks to assist the disabled handler, they are allowed public access rights the same as their handler. They are allowed to go EVERYWHERE the handler is, so that it may continue to assist the handler in any given situation.\nThe different between a Therapy Dog and a Service Dog is significant and needs to be well understood by handlers and law officers as well.\nA Therapy Dog is considered a PET, while a Service Dog is NOT A PET.\n|I couldn't resist posting this....it's just too cute|\nBusinesses and establishments that do not allow pets, will not allow a Therapy Dog inside, unless special permission was granted beforehand for special visits.\nThe Video below describes the laws on Service Dog pretty well.",

    "- For the braconid wasp genus, see Agathis (wasp).\n- For details on New Zealand Kauri, see Agathis australis\n- The type of gastropod marine mollusc is spelled cowrie, while the New Zealand land mollusc is spelled Kauri.\n|This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2009)|\nThe genus Agathis, commonly known as kauri or dammar, is a relatively small genus of 21 species of evergreen tree. The genus is part of the ancient Araucariaceae family of conifers, a group once widespread during the Jurassic period, but now largely restricted to the Southern Hemisphere except for a number of extant Malesian Agathis.\nMature kauri trees have characteristically large trunks, forming a bole with little or no branching below the crown. In contrast, young trees are normally conical in shape, forming a more rounded or irregularly shaped crown as they achieve maturity.\nThe bark is smooth and light grey to grey-brown, usually peeling into irregular flakes that become thicker on more mature trees. The branch structure is often horizontal or, when larger, ascending. The lowest branches often leave circular branch scars when they detach from the lower trunk.\nThe juvenile leaves in all species are larger than the adult, more or less acute, varying among the species from ovate to lanceolate. Adult leaves are opposite, elliptical to linear, very leathery and quite thick. Young leaves are often a coppery-red, contrasting markedly with the usually green or glaucous-green foliage of the previous season.\nThe male pollen cones appear usually only on larger trees after seed cones have appeared. The female seed cones usually develop on short lateral branchlets, maturing after two years. They are normally oval or globe shaped.\nVarious species of kauri give diverse resins such as kauri copal, Manilla copal and Dammar gum. The timber is generally straight-grained and of fine quality with an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and rot resistance, making it ideal for yacht hull construction. The wood is commonly used in the manufacture of low priced guitars due to its good resonating properties, yet relatively low price of production. It is also used for some Go boards (goban). The uses of the New Zealand species (A. australis) included shipbuilding, house construction, wood panelling, furniture making, mine braces, and railway sleepers.\n- Agathis atropurpurea—Black Kauri, Blue Kauri (Queensland, Australia)\n- Agathis australis—Kauri, New Zealand Kauri (North Island, New Zealand)\n- Agathis borneensis (western Malesia, Borneo)\n- Agathis corbassonii—Red Kauri (New Caledonia)\n- Agathis dammara (syn.

    "Moderating your food consumption is the most important component of a healthy, balanced diet. Incorporating concepts such as food combining and food rotation can also be beneficial when addressing poor digestion or food allergies. Following these simple guidelines below will help support your digestion and a strong immune system.\nEat Whole Natural Foods:\nWhole natural foods that come direct from gardens, farms and orchards are the best choices for optimal nutrients, energy and vitality. Fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes should ideally constitute 60-70% of your diet. Although processed food has an undeniable convenience factor and longer shelf life, they typically contain unnecessary additives and chemicals that can be detrimental to your health in the long run.\nWhile not always the budget-friendly option, there are many benefits to eating organic whenever possible. Many believe that organically grown foods have a higher nutrient value than commercially grown produce, while others disagree. There are many studies to prove either side. What cannot be disputed is the undeniable benefit associated with the minimization of chemicals sprayed on organically grown produce, and therefore the reduced toxic load our bodies have to deal with.\nEat Naturally-Raised Meats (Fish, Seafood, Poultry, Beef, Lamb and Eggs):\nProtein is an important component in diets, as it is the building block of all of our cells – and therefore our muscles, tissues and organs. And it is a tremendous source of vitamin B12 and iron. Due to its high fat content, it is important to consider only lean sources of protein. And to minimize our chemical and hormone exposure, look for naturally raised sources of protein.\nEat Raw or Lightly Steamed Vegetables:\nFruits and vegetables are best eaten as fresh as possible, though many can be stored well for several weeks. To maximize the nutrient value of fruits and vegetables, it’s best to eat them raw or lightly steamed. When cooked, many of the vitamins, some minerals and certainly the enzymes in fruits and vegetables are lost, thereby reducing their nutrient value.\nEat in Moderation:\nAs a general guideline, every meal and snack should have 40% lean protein, 20% fat and 40% complex carbohydrates for optimum nutrition and satisfaction. One of the best things you can do is to always eat a healthy balanced breakfast, setting up your metabolism properly for the day. If you have time constraints, consider options such as protein smoothies, healthy muffins, hardboiled eggs or granola with fruit, nuts and seeds.\nEliminate or Minimize Caffeine:\nCaffeine is a stimulant that helps us feel temporarily energized, but it has many negative effects to the body. It has a laxative effect that may cover up sluggish bowels; it’s also a diuretic that causes frequent urination and dehydration, which can lead to many physical symptoms if taken in excess, including insomnia, high blood pressure and headaches.\nUse Natural Sweeteners in Moderation:\nGenerally, it’s best to minimize sugar due to its well-documented impact on health, including hypoglycemia, weight gain, cravings, high cholesterol and dental cavities to name a few. When a sweetener is required, consider natural sources such as raw honey and maple syrup instead.\nEliminate or Limit Alcohol:\nThe negative effects of excessive alcohol use are well documented. Even in moderate amounts, alcohol is a diuretic and also uses up B vitamins as it is processed from the body, so it’s best to eliminate or strictly limit consumption.\nGet Plenty of Sleep:\nThe importance of sleep is often overlooked. During sleep, our muscles and tissues are repaired and revitalized, and our minds process experiences and things we have learned during the day. Although we all have different sleep patterns and needs, the average person requires a minimum of seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep per night.\nTo achieve optimal sleep, avoid consumption of caffeine, heavy meals, exercise or alcohol within a few hours before bed. Before bed, consider reading, journaling or meditation to relax, as the day’s anxieties and an overactive mind can also impact your ability to sleep. And finally, ensure that your sleeping environment is set up for the best quality of sleep – minimize noise and keep the bedroom as dark as possible.\nExercise – Move your Body!:\nMany feel that exercise only includes weekly classes, trips to the gym or running. The reality is that any form of exercise is beneficial, including morning or evening walks, or even taking the stairs whenever possible. Ideally, find an activity you enjoy doing and do it as frequently as possible. If finding the time becomes a challenge, use simple methods such as parking your car farther away from your destination and even taking business meetings outdoors and making them “walking meetings”. The key is to find every opportunity in a day to get your body moving.",
    "An accessor method is an instance method that gets or sets the value of a property of an object. In Cocoa’s terminology, a method that retrieves the value of an object’s property is referred to as a getter method, or “getter;” a method that changes the value of an object’s property is referred to as a setter method, or “setter.” These methods are often found in pairs, providing API for getting and setting the property values of an object.\nYou should use accessor methods rather than directly accessing state data because they provide an abstraction layer. Here are just two of the benefits that accessor methods provide:\nYou don’t need to rewrite your code if the manner in which a property is represented or stored changes.\nAccessor methods often implement important behavior that occurs whenever a value is retrieved or set. For example, setter methods frequently implement memory management code and notify other objects when a value is changed.\nBecause of the importance of this pattern, Cocoa defines some conventions for naming accessor methods. Given a property of type\ntype and called\nname, you should typically implement accessor methods with the following form:\nThe one exception is a property that is a Boolean value. Here the getter method name may be\nisName. For example:\nThis naming convention is important because much other functionality in Cocoa relies upon it, in particular key-value coding. Cocoa does not use\ngetName because methods that start with “get” in Cocoa indicate that the method will return values by reference.",
    "The capacitance of a capacitor is fixed once it is constructed, as the only way to change the capacitance is to change its \"build\" parameters: the area A and/or the separation distance d.\nSo just how much charge could a capacitor store on its plates? When does a capacitor \"know\" when to stop charging?\n(The units for charge (in coulombs, C) and potential (in volts, V; or joules/coulomb, J/C) again work out to coulombs2 per joule, or farads for the capacitance.)\nThe key is to realize that the capacitance of a capacitor, once built, is fixed. However, one can change the amount of potential applied to the capacitor (by connecting different batteries, etc.). With a given value of capacitance, then applying a high potential to the capacitor will allow it to store more charge, and applying a low potential to the capacitor will have it store less charge.\nThus capacitance can be said to be a measure of \"charge-storing efficiency\" with respect to a given potential, in that a large capacitance capacitor will store more charge than one with a small capacitance, if they are connected to the same potential source (such as a battery).\nThus the first electron moved costs nothing (or nearly nothing), while the last electron requires a much higher q·∆V cost to move. The average cost of moving each electron, then, can be said to be (1/2)·q·∆V, such that the total cost of moving all electrons is (1/2)·Q·∆V, where the total charge of all N electrons moved is Q = N·q. (This argument is deliberately trying to avoid calculus to integrate the gradually increasing cost of each electron over all electrons moved, but the result is the same.)\nEndless hours of amusement await you when solving capacitor energy problems, so use caution when you use these equations, and more importantly, use only the equation you really need.",
    "Next: My Tiles are Cracking in the Corners\nMy tiles are wearing out\nTiles are well known for their durability and wear resistance. But, we need to always remember that tiles are not indestructible. If mistreated, or subjected to harsh conditions, or wrongly selected for purpose, the glaze on a ceramic tile will scratch or it can wear.\nThere needs to be an understanding of the difference between 'wearing' and'scratching.' Wearing is where the glazed surface is thinning and eventually actually work through. Scratching is damage to the surface from a harder substance that scratches the glaze. Heavy scratching can actually dull the surface of a glazed tile. It is damage to the surface, but it is not actually wearing through. Much like granite in a heavy traffic area will dull off from scratching, but is not worn.\nThe best way to avoid tiles becoming worn is to get good advice when selecting them. This way, tiles that are suited to the area can be chosen and that includes for reasons such as colour, ease of cleaning, durability, and resistance to wear.\nThe other way is to keep the floor clean and free from sand and abrasive dirt. This is especially important at doorways to the outside of a home or building. Abrasive grit is brought in under shoes and if there is a doormat, this grit is removed and left on the doormat. Even gravel (which can be equally as hard as granite) can be trapped under a shoe and then trodden onto the tiled surface.\nWhat can cause the problem?\n• Absense of doormats at doorways to the outside of a home. These remove grit and sand from shoes which can be very abrasive on tiled surfaces. Think of sandpaper, which can actually just be sand trapped on the paper, yet is highly abrasive.\n• Incorrectly specified tiles that are not suited to the traffic conditions of an area. Always heed the advice of the Beaumont Tiles consultant and explain clearly the conditions to which the tiles will be subject.\n• Keep your tiles clean. A clean tile won't have a film of accumulated grinding dirt on the surface.\n• Avoid the use of unnecessary chemicals, especially acid based ones and the use of hard cleaning implements such as steel wool. These too will deteriorate the surface of a tile.\nSo what can I do now?\nOnce the glaze on tiles has worn, it can't be rejuvenated in any way.\nLikewise, damage by harsh scratching cannot be reversed.\nScratched tiles will continue to perform as a tile should. But, once a tile surface has worn through, and the protective glazed surface is gone, the tile will need to be replaced.",
    "From Ohio History Central\nAlanson Pomeroy was a politician, a businessman, and a conductor on the Underground Railroad in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.\nPomeroy was born on February 20, 1805, in Massachusetts. He eventually relocated to Strongsville, in Cuyahoga County. In January 1831, Pomeroy married Kezia Pope. The couple remained in Strongsville, completing construction on a prominent home, named \"The Homestead,\" in 1848. Pomeroy supported his family by owning at least two stores in northeastern Ohio, including one in Strongsville. He also was involved in the banking industry in nearby Cleveland, Ohio and also in Berea, Ohio. A prominent member of the community, Pomeroy won election to several government positions, including justice of the peace and Strongsville trustee. He also assumed a leadership position in the local Congregational Church.\nBesides his political and economic pursuits, Pomeroy and his wife served as conductors on the Underground Railroad. They secreted fugitive slaves in the cellar of their home. Pomeroy commonly brought the runaways from Oberlin, Ohio in the back of a wagon. He concealed the fugitives under hay while transporting them. He would then take the African Americans to Rocky River, where he placed them on board boats that took the runaway slaves to freedom in Canada.\nPomeroy died on January 4, 1877. In 1980, Pomeroy's home became a restaurant known as Don's Pomeroy House Restaurant, Pub & Patio.\nPomeroy represents the growing tensions over slavery between Northerners and Southerners during the early nineteenth century. While many Northern states had provisions outlawing slavery, runaway slaves did not necessarily gain their freedom upon arriving in a free state. Federal law permitted slaveowners to reclaim their runaway slaves. Some slaves managed to escape their owners on their own, while others sometimes received assistance from sympathetic Northerners, such as Pomeroy.",
    "Subsequent Nuremberg Trials\nThe Subsequent Nuremberg Trials formally the Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals were a series of twelve U.S. military tribunals for war crimes against surviving members of the leadership of Nazi Germany, held in the Palace of Justice, Nuremberg, after World War II from 1946 to 1949 following the Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal.\nAlthough it had been initially planned to hold more than just one international trial at the IMT, the growing differences between the victorious allies (the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Soviet Union) made this impossible. However, the Control Council Law No. 10, which the Allied Control Council had issued on December 20, 1945, empowered any of the occupying authorities to try suspected war criminals in their respective occupation zones. Based on this law, the U.S. authorities proceeded after the end of the initial Nuremberg Trial against the major war criminals to hold another twelve trials in Nuremberg. The judges in all these trials were American, and so were the prosecutors; the Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution was Brigadier General Telford Taylor. In the other occupation zones similar trials took place.\nThe twelve U.S. trials before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals (NMT) took place from December 9, 1946 to April 13, 1949. The trials were:\n- The Doctors' Trial (9 December 1946 - 20 August 1947)\n- The Milch Trial (2 January - 14 April 1947)\n- The Judges' Trial (5 March - 4 December 1947)\n- The Pohl Trial (8 April - 3 November 1947)\n- The Flick Trial (19 April - 22 December 1947)\n- The IG Farben Trial (27 August 1947 - 30 July 1948)\n- The Hostages Trial (8 July 1947 – 19 February 1948)\n- The RuSHA Trial (20 October 1947 - 10 March 1948)\n- The Einsatzgruppen Trial (29 September 1947 - 10 April 1948)\n- The Krupp Trial (8 December 1947 - 31 July 1948)\n- The Ministries Trial (6 January 1948 - 13 April 1949)\n- The High Command Trial (30 December 1947 - 28 October 1948)\nIn total, 142 of the 185 defendants were found guilty of at least one of the charges. 24 persons received death sentences, of which 11 were subsequently converted into life sentences; 20 were sentenced to life imprisonment, 98 were handed down sentences of varying lengths, and 35 were acquitted. Four defendants had to be removed from trials due to illness, and four more committed suicide during the trials.\nMany of the longer prison sentences were reduced substantially by decree of high commissioner John J. McCloy in 1951, and 10 outstanding death sentences from the Einsatzgruppen Trial were converted to prison terms. The same year, an amnesty released many of those who had received prison sentences.\nSome of the NMTs have been criticised for their misguided conclusion that \"morale bombing\" of civilians, including its nuclear variety, was legal, and for their judgement that, in certain situations, executing civilians in reprisal was permissible.\nConduct of the prosecution \nIn a 2005 interview for the Washington Post, Benjamin B. Ferencz, Chief Prosecutor for the United States Army at the Einsatzgruppen Trial, revealed some of his activities during his period in Germany:\n- \"I once saw DPs beat an SS man and then strap him to the steel gurney of a crematorium. They slid him in the oven, turned on the heat and took him back out. Beat him again, and put him back in until he was burnt alive. I did nothing to stop it. I suppose I could have brandished my weapon or shot in the air, but I was not inclined to do so. Does that make me an accomplice to murder?\"\nIn the interview, Ferencz also pointed out that the military legal norms at the time permitted actions that would not be possible today.\n- \"You know how I got witness statements? I'd go into a village where, say, an American pilot had parachuted and been beaten to death and line everyone one up against the wall. Then I'd say, 'Anyone who lies will be shot on the spot.' It never occurred to me that statements taken under duress would be invalid.\"\nSee also \n- Auschwitz Trial held in Kraków, Poland in 1947 against 40 SS-staff of the Auschwitz concentration camp death factory\n- Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials, 1963–65\n- Majdanek Trials, the longest Nazi war crimes trial in history, spanning over 30 years\n- Chełmno Trials of the Chełmno extermination camp personel, held in Poland and in Germany.

    "Lesson 2: Servers\nPHP is a server-side technology. Therefore, you need to have a server to run PHP. But it doesn't need to cost you anything to make this upgrade and there are several options for doing so.\nSince you ultimately only need to choose one option, this lesson is divided into three parts. First comes a little introduction on the different options (just choose the one that suits you best). When your server is up and running, we'll pick up with Lesson 3 to make your first PHP page.\nOption 1: Website on a hosted server\nYou can choose to have a website on a host that supports PHP.\n- Test whether your host supports PHP\n- If you don't already have a website on hosted server you can create a free account on 000webhost.com which supports PHP.\nOption 2: Install PHP on your computer\nIt's no walk in the park to install PHP on your computer. This option is only recommend for experienced computer users, but it can obviously be done. Here are links to downloads and installtion guides:\nOption 3: XAMPP\nXAMPP is a program that makes it easy and possible for us ordinary folks to run the PHP directly on our computer without having to install PHP on our own.\n|Related topics in the PHP Forum||Replies||Views|\n|About IIS Server||1||69|\n|problem with xampp and php codes||3||598|\n|Xampp \"hello world!\" not working.||6||2909|\n|problem with Xampp 1.8.1||7||1898|",
    "The \"Around the Web\" series highlights informative websites, and also targeted blog posts and news articles, relevant to the courses I teach. This semester I teach Anth 143: Biology of Human Behavior, an introductory-level course that covers the basics of evolution, behavioral biology, and the interaction of biology and culture. My hope is that these posts are useful not only for my current students, but other people hoping to gain background or insight into these topics.\nOn the week we learned about stress and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, we didn't just talk about Type A personalities or parachute jumping. Instead, I tried to apply our understanding of how acute and chronic stress impact the body by examining social disparities and racism. This led to all of us being confronted with some very harsh statistics about the health of people of color in this country and the long-term effects of systemic oppression, and powerful narratives about internalized oppression in first and second-generation immigrants.\nI wanted to augment that lecture with some links on social disparities and racism. I have a TON of links for this topic, so enjoy!\nCheck my what?\nFirst, some primers to help us contextualize social disparity and conversations about it. One of my favorites is \"Check my what?\" On privilege and what we can do about it. This is a post that does get updated from time to time, and it defines privilege, and instructs the reader how to identify one's own privilege, accept it, and from that point of acceptance, move towards actions and attitudes that are pro-equality. I like this because of the way it implicitly explains the uselessness of the seemingly pro-equality stance of \"not seeing color.\"\nA slightly more humorous, but still important, primer, is called Derailing for Dummies. I hope a reading of this primer will help people communicate respectfully around oppression.\nI also wanted to share a few posts about Western perspectives on mental health, because of the time we spent in class on immigration. Aspects of immigration and acculturation are stressful, and cultural contexts strongly influence behavior. Another issue to consider is whether Western perspectives on mental health overpathologize context-dependent behaviors (that is, doing things that make sense in context and are occurring in context, like a toddler tantrum, or grieving after losing a loved one). Take a look at these links: Will anyone be normal? discusses the overpathologization issue I just mentioned; Westerners vs. the World: we are the WEIRD ones brings population variation in behavior to light; and a related story interviewing Ethan Watters, Going Mad the American Way.\nThe science of oppression\nIn addition to the material we learned in lecture on race and immigration, I wanted to add some other good sources. Science of oppression I is a great primer from Racialicious. Scicurious also has a great researchblogging post on inflammatory responses to stress, particularly as they relate to social rejection. She reviews a particular paper that links immune health to neural sensitivity to social rejection (meaning, those demonstrating the most sensitivity to social rejection also had an increase in inflammatory markers), which is interesting since it demonstrates a relationship between the immune system and psychosocial stress.\nThis Jonah Lehrer article in Wired follows up on the Sapolsky article we read about stress vaccines. I also like this story (well, press release) from ScienceDaily on how stress relates to one's coping method. I imagine this is also linked, in some ways, to the study Scicurious discussed on neural sensitivity. It seems as though if we can change some of our coping and sensitivity behaviors, we can probably alter the degree to which stress negatively impacts our health. I also wanted to link to this special edition of Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences that was exclusively on \"The Biology of Disadvantage.\" Really great articles in there. Finally, this post at Language Log critically analyzes some of the ways in which we misunderstand and essentialize disadvantage. An important read.\nRandom, unrelated, but always interesting, stuff\nPatrick Clarkin has a great post on Evolutionary Aesthetics -- basically, the idea that our concept of beauty is context-dependent in more ways than we may realize. I found it inspiring and insightful.\nHere's a weird story about mercury exposure and how it changes the sexual behavior of the ibis. See how flexible sexuality can be?\nThis is a piece I really enjoyed on the ways in which current journalism practices don't get at the subtlety and complexity of science. It refers back to a kerfuffle earlier this year when Martin Robbins of the Lay Scientist wrote a very funny satire piece called This is a news website article about a scientific paper.\nFinally, while it's a bit belated, a nice Thanksgiving post by Krystal D'Costa over at Anthropology in Practice.",
    "Healthy Kids Recipes\nAlmond-Crusted Chicken Fingers\nBaked Mac & Cheese\nHealthy Eating for Kids Recipes and Menus\nHealthy Kids Lunch Recipes & Tips\nI’ve been thrilled by my husband’s eating evolution, but I had never really stopped to consider how a man who had eaten one way for over 30 years successfully pulled off a dietary one-eighty. Then, a few months ago at a nutrition conference, I attended a lecture on taste preferences by Julie Mennella, Ph.D., a scientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. “What we like to eat is shaped by both biology and experience,” Dr. Mennella explained. Jack’s diet transformation was starting to make sense.\nThere are five distinct tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami, which means “savory” in Japanese and is associated with meats and cheeses. When we eat, chemicals in our food are sensed by the thousands of taste buds on the bumpy projections (fungiform papillae) of our tongues. The chemicals attach to receptors in the buds, sending signals to the brain, which registers taste perceptions. Receptors also respond to the temperature of foods and chemicals that create physical sensations (think of chili with fiery jalapeños). Smell plays into one’s flavor experiences, too: foods release chemicals that travel up the nose to olfactory receptors, triggering a chain reaction of signals that amplify taste perceptions. (Prove this to yourself by holding your nose and sampling a jelly bean: you’ll taste sweet, but won’t get a burst of “flavor”—the term used to refer to taste plus smell—until you unplug your nose.",
    "Why is a strikebreaker called a scab?\nA scab is the hard crust that forms over a wound when it is healing, but in earlier use it meant a disease of the skin. The word comes from the Old Norse *skabb. It’s not attested to in English, however, until the 13th century. From the Old Kentish Sermons, c.1250:\nSi lepre [signefieþ] þo sennen, þet scab bi-tokned þo litle sennen.\n(Leprosy [signifies] those sins, so that scab betokens those little sins.)\nBy the end of the 16th century, the word was being used as an insult, denoting a low person, a scoundrel, a rascal. From Robert Greene’s c.1590 The Honorable Historie of Frier Bacon and Frier Bongay:\nLoue is such a proud scab, that he will neuer meddle with fooles nor children.\nThe specialization to labor disputes dates to at least 1777, when the word was used in this sense in Bonner & Middleton’s Bristol Journal:\nWhereas the Master Cordwainers have gloried, that there has been a Demur amongst the Men’s and Women’s Men;—we have the Pleasure to inform them, that Matters are amicably settled...The Conflict would not been [sic] so sharp had not there been so many dirty Scabs; no Doubt but timely Notice will be taken of them.\n(Source: Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition)\nCopyright 1997-2013, by David Wilton",
    "THE BORDER WALL DOES NOT WORK\nAll of the imagined benefits of the border wall flow from the assumption that if walls are built they will stop undocumented traffic from coming across. Politicians claim that building 700 miles of wall along our 1,933 mile long southern border, while ignoring the 3,987 mile long northern border and 12,479 miles of coastline will somehow allow the Department of Homeland Security to achieve the Secure Fence Act's goal, to \"achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States.\"\nIn fact, the Border Patrol's own statistics show that the border walls have not brought about a decrease in illegal entries. The border patrol uses the number of border crossers apprehended in a given sector to gauge the overall number of attempted crossings. Apprehensions dropped dramatically between 2005, the year before the Secure Fence Act was passed, and 2007, the year after. But the decrease did not occur in areas where border walls had been built. On the contrary, the greatest reductions in apprehensions, which according to the Border Patrol would indicate a successful strategy for stopping undocumented immigration, were seen in sectors that did not have walls. Texas' Rio Grande Valley sector saw a 45.3% decrease in apprehensions, bringing them to a 15 year low. The Del Rio, Texas, sector saw a 66.5% decrease. Neither sector had an inch of border wall before 2008. In sectors such as Tucson, which saw walls built shortly after passage of the Secure Fence Act, the reduction in apprehensions began before any wall posts were erected. The areas that saw an increase in crossings were California's San Diego and El Centro sectors, both of which have had border walls for over a decade. At the same time that the unwalled border witnessed dramatic decreases in crossings, heavily fortified San Diego saw a 20.1% increase.\nEven before the passage of the Secure Fence Act, it was clear that border walls did not reduce the number of people entering the United States. The Congressional Research Service found that the number of border crossers apprehended nationally in 1992 was the same as the number apprehended in 2004, after walls in San Diego had been erected. They concluded that migrant traffic had simply shifted to more remote areas in Arizona and that \"increased enforcement in San Diego sector has had little impact on overall apprehensions.\" Migrants were not stopped by border walls; they simply went around them.\nOther researchers have studied the effectiveness of the border wall and border enforcement by analyzing how successful migrants are at getting through it. The Migrant Policy Institute found that 97% of undocumented immigrants eventually succeed in entering the United States, a number that has been unchanged since the first border walls went up in 1995. Wayne Cornelius, Director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California-San Diego told the House Judiciary Committee that according to his research.\nTightened border enforcement since 1993 has not stopped nor even discouraged unauthorized migrants from entering the United States. Even if apprehended, the vast majority (92-97%) keep trying until they succeed. Neither the higher probability of being apprehended by the Border Patrol, nor the sharply increased danger of clandestine entry through deserts and mountainous terrain, has discouraged potential migrants from leaving home.\nAssertions by pundits and politicians that walls will allow the U.S. to \"secure\" its southern border are patently false. Spokespersons for the Border Patrol tend to describe it much more modestly. Del Rio, Texas, Border Patrol Chief Randy Hill said, \"We're going to see steel barriers erected on the borders where U.S. and Mexican cities adjoin. These will slow down illegal crossers by minutes.\" Not stop crossers, or allow the Border Patrol to \"achieve and maintain operational control\" of the border, but slow them down by \"minutes.\" As Border Patrol spokesperson Mike Scioli said, \"The border fence is a speed bump in the desert.\"\nEven Bush administration Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff said in 2007, \"I think the fence has come to assume a certain kind of symbolic significance which should not obscure the fact that it is a much more complicated problem than putting up a fence which someone can climb over with a ladder or tunnel under with a shovel.\"\nMile upon mile of border wall have been built, with no apparent thought given to efficacy, because the Secure Fence Act only mandated a mile count. There is no requirement that border walls have any measurable impact on immigration or smuggling, and in 2009 the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Homeland Security had made no effort to determine whether or not walls were having any effect. Even the Border Patrol has questioned whether walls are being built in some locations for political, rather than operational, reasons. In a 2007 email obtained by the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) through a Freedom of Information Act request, the Assistant Chief Patrol Agent for the Yuma sector asks, \"will we be getting fence where we don't need it in our sector for the sake of putting up the required mileage?\" The miles of unnecessary border wall that he referred to have since been built through the Imperial Sand Dunes of Southern California.\nDespite its \"symbolic significance\" and its possibly arbitrary placement, the border wall comes with a real price tag. In 2007 the Congressional Research Service estimated that the border wall could cost as much as $49 billion to build and maintain. Since then the costs of construction have risen dramatically. The Army Corps of Engineers reported that the cost of building \"pedestrian fences\" has increased from an average of $3.5 million per mile to $7.5 million per mile. The cost of building vehicle barriers on the border is now $2.8 million per mile. Some sections of border wall are particularly expensive: the walls that have been inserted into the levees in south Texas averaged $12 million per mile; in California, a 3.5 mile section that involved filling in canyons cost taxpayers $57 million. In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security asked Congress to allocate an additional $400 million for border wall construction, because the $2.7 billion already spent was not enough to finish out the year.\nWhy would members of Congress vote to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on border walls that do not work?\nSimply put, for members of Congress who do not live beside the border, and do not count on the votes of those who do, the border wall is an abstraction. The reality that the border wall has little or no impact on border crossings is irrelevant. The reality that more than 400 property owners have had their property condemned is irrelevant. The reality that federally designated wilderness areas and wildlife refuges have been severely impacted is irrelevant. The politicians who voted for border walls were voting for a symbol, something that could be used to give voters a false sense of security during election cycles, and nothing more.",
    "Helping Your Child Build Inner Strength\nWhat Is Inner Strength?\nInner strength, often called \"resilience,\" is the ability to cope with the stressful situations that life throws at us.\nBuilding inner strength begins with simple actions or thoughts that your child practices, such as planning for what to do next and learning to accept change. Inner strength can help a child face problems. Children who are resilient:\n- Are more likely to grow into healthy, happy adults, even in the face of poverty, divorce, or family tragedy.\n- Are better able to stand up to peer pressure so they can avoid using drugs, drinking alcohol, and smoking.\n- Are better able to resist messages in the media that tell them to be or look a certain way.\n- Feel confident when meeting new people.\n- Like to do nice things for others.\n- Are loving and lovable.\n- Are optimistic about life.\nChildren often surprise us with how resilient they are. But there is much you can do as a parent to help your young child or your teenager grow stronger.\nBy working to develop a child's inner strength, you are giving that child the emotional and mental tools needed to stay healthy and happy throughout life.\n|By:||Reference Healthwise Staff||Last Revised: Reference December 9, 2011|\n|Medical Review:||Reference Susan C.

    "A team led by Yale University researchers has created the first rudimentary solid-state quantum processor, taking another step toward the ultimate dream of building a quantum computer.\nThey also used the two-qubit superconducting chip to successfully run elementary algorithms, such as a simple search, demonstrating quantum information processing with a solid-state device for the first time. Their findings will appear in Nature’s advanced online publication June 28.\n“Our processor can perform only a few very simple quantum tasks, which have been demonstrated before with single nuclei, atoms and photons,” said Robert Schoelkopf, the William A. Norton Professor of Applied Physics & Physics at Yale. “But this is the first time they’ve been possible in an all-electronic device that looks and feels much more like a regular microprocessor.”\nWorking with a group of theoretical physicists led by Steven Girvin, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics & Applied Physics, the team manufactured two artificial atoms, or qubits (“quantum bits”). While each qubit is actually made up of a billion aluminum atoms, it acts like a single atom that can occupy two different energy states. These states are akin to the “1” and “0” or “on” and “off” states of regular bits employed by conventional computers. Because of the counterintuitive laws of quantum mechanics, however, scientists can effectively place qubits in a “superposition” of multiple states at the same time, allowing for greater information storage and processing power.\nFor example, imagine having four phone numbers, including one for a friend, but not knowing which number belonged to that friend. You would typically have to try two to three numbers before you dialed the right one. A quantum processor, on the other hand, can find the right number in only one try.\n“Instead of having to place a phone call to one number, then another number, you use quantum mechanics to speed up the process,” Schoelkopf said. “It’s like being able to place one phone call that simultaneously tests all four numbers, but only goes through to the right one.”\nThese sorts of computations, though simple, have not been possible using solid-state qubits until now in part because scientists could not get the qubits to last long enough. While the first qubits of a decade ago were able to maintain specific quantum states for about a nanosecond, Schoelkopf and his team are now able to maintain theirs for a microsecond—a thousand times longer, which is enough to run the simple algorithms. To perform their operations, the qubits communicate with one another using a “quantum bus”—photons that transmit information through wires connecting the qubits—previously developed by the Yale group.\nThe key that made the two-qubit processor possible was getting the qubits to switch “on” and “off” abruptly, so that they exchanged information quickly and only when the researchers wanted them to, said Leonardo DiCarlo, a postdoctoral associate in applied physics at Yale’s School of Engineering & Applied Science and lead author of the paper.\nNext, the team will work to increase the amount of time the qubits maintain their quantum states so they can run more complex algorithms. They will also work to connect more qubits to the quantum bus. The processing power increases exponentially with each qubit added, Schoelkopf said, so the potential for more advanced quantum computing is enormous. But he cautions it will still be some time before quantum computers are being used to solve complex problems.\n“We’re still far away from building a practical quantum computer, but this is a major step forward.”\nAuthors of the paper include Leonardo DiCarlo, Jerry M.

    "Brian W Evans\n(image is missing)\nHere are two drawings that show the pinout, or the physical location of each pin, of the Arduino microcontroller and the most basic running circuit diagram. There are some tradeoffs by using this method, like having to program the chip in the Arduino before unplugging it and plugging it into the board but for minimal design this is a good option. (Although Paul Badger's Real Bare Bones Board is pretty small too and might save some work.)\nThe most complicated part of the process is wiring up the crystal or resonator. There are 2 possible choices here, both work pretty much the same but I find the crystal easier to hook up on a solderless breadboard or similar perfboard.\nThe rest of the hookup is pretty straightforward, just make sure the right pins are properly wired to either +5v or Ground.\nThere are a couple of components to make this work.\nCrystal or Resonator:\nIf this is being soldered to a perfboard you need a socket for the chip:\nYou will not need a socket if this is only going into a solderless breadboard.\nTo power it up, you need a clean stable source of 5 volts DC. This means that you either pick up a switching 5V DC power supply from your favorite retailer, mail order one from Jameco or you will have to wire up a voltage regulator. Page 254 of Tom Igoe's Physical Computing has a nice layout of a 7805 voltage regulator with a couple decoupling capacitors.\nFor the voltage regulator you will need these parts:\nFinally you will need something to stick all these parts into. Feel free to use anything you want: plastic, wood, a herring... The easiest method is to just use a spare breadboard, but the second easiest method is to permantly solder everything together using a copper clad perf board available at Radio Shack. These have holes drilled in a phenolic substrate with little copper rings, or pads, on one side.\nOk, that is basically it. I will update this as time permits with additional drawings and photos.",
    "Alcohol Awareness Month Sheds Light on US Drinking\nThe purpose of April's Alcohol Awareness Month is to help the millions of Americans who don't seek help.\nHow much do you drink? In honor of Alcohol Awareness Month in April, non-profit treatment organization the Gateway Foundation has conducted a survey to encourage people to examine their own drinking habits. Altogether, 73% of adults surveyed confirmed that they drink; when asked how many drinks they down per session, the most popular response was two drinks—in line with government recommendations for men (they recommend one for women). On the other hand, nearly one in 10 confessed to drinking four or five drinks per drinking event, which could indicate trouble. \"Most people can have a couple drinks and be fine; but for some people, drinking alcoholic beverages creates a strong craving for more,\" says Dr. Phil Welches, Clinical Director for the Gateway Foundation. \"For example, when a person consistently drinks four to five drinks a couple nights a week and experiences blackouts and frequent hangovers, it is possible that a drinking problem is developing.\" The online survey sampled 2,265 adults ages 21 and over. The National Survey on Drug Abuse and Health—administered by the federal government—found that of the 23 million Americans who need help for alcoholism, only 3 million actually seek treatment.",

    "O'Reilly Book Excerpts: Java Programming with Oracle SQLJ\nContexts and Multithreading\nThis excerpt is Chapter 8 from Java Programming with Oracle SQLJ, published in August 2001 by O'Reilly.\nThere are two important objects used in SQLJ that affect the execution of database operations: connection contexts and execution contexts. Connection contexts are used to connect to a database. All embedded SQL statements within a SQLJ program run in a connection context. Connection contexts make it possible to create multiple connections to a database or to connect to more than one database at a time. An execution context is used to hold the number of rows affected by a SQL operation, along with any warnings generated by the database. Execution contexts are used to control certain aspects of how a SQL statement is executed. For example, you can use an execution context to control the timeout period after which a SQL operation is abandoned.\nA multithreaded program is one that is able to carry out several tasks in parallel using Java threads. As you will see in this chapter, execution contexts are very important when writing a multithreaded SQLJ program.",
    "The Beardsley Zoo, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, is the only zoo in the state of Connecticut. The beauty of the entire complex, both the park and zoo, is one of the reasons Bridgeport has earned the nickname \"The Park City.\"\nIn 1884, the city contracted Frederick Law Olmsted, famous for creating New York City's Central Park, to create a design for Beardsley Park. Mr. Olmsted's plan was to create a simple, rural park for the residents to enjoy.\nThe City of Bridgeport was also home of Mr. Phineas T. Barnum and his world famous circus. At the time of the Park's creation, Mr. Barnum usually exercised his animals through the streets of Bridgeport, and it was common to see zebras and camels walking up and down the city's Main Street. After Beardsley Park was created, Mr. Barnum and the circus company began exercising the animals there.\nIn 1920, Bridgeport Parks Commissioner, Mr. Wesley Hayes, began a campaign to create a City Zoo within the Park. He requested that the citizens of Bridgeport contribute animals to start the zoo. In the first year there were eighteen exotic birds donated. Barnum and Bailey Circus also donated some of their retired animals to the zoo.\nIn 1997, the Connecticut Zoological Society, a nonprofit support group for the zoo, purchased the zoo from the city and continues to run the zoo as a private, nonprofit institution with assistance from the State of Connecticut and the City of Bridgeport.\nCONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND BEARDSLEY ZOO SPONSORING AMNESTY DAY FOR PROHIBITED EXOTIC ANIMALS\nMar 25, 2012; HARTFORD, Conn., March 21 -- The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection issued the following news release: The...\nThursday: Gov.

In his book \"From Eternity to Here,\" physicist Sean Carroll seeks to create a better understanding of time. According to Carroll, time's one-way arrow is due to conditions before the Big Bang. He argues that our universe is part of a larger family of universes- and that in sibling universes, time runs in the opposite direction.

    "\"Collaborative efforts of this nature are crucial to obtain reliable data and determine the direction of the future of education.\"\n—Marcy P. Driscoll\nFederal grant at FSU to help science teachers foster 'inquiry learning'\nby Barry Ray\nThree Florida State University programs have joined forces to research how to better prepare teachers to combat science illiteracy in the United States—and they are receiving a helping hand from the National Science Foundation (NSF). Through a $2.4-million award, FSU's College of Arts and Sciences, College of Education and National High Magnetic Field Laboratory will study how to more effectively train teachers in the inquiry processes that are at the core of science and central to science teaching.\nScience teacher seeks a kernel of truth while working on a project involving irradiated popcorn as part of a Magnet Lab summer program for teachers. (Photo: Center for Integrating Research & Learning, NHMFL)\nThe National Science Board reported in January of this year that it is \"absolutely essential for our nation's long-term prosperity and security that we remain a world leader in science and technology…(yet) our nation continues to slip further behind in the science and mathematics achievement of U.S. students relative to international peers.\" The board added that the critical lack of technically trained people in the United States can be traced directly to poor K-12 mathematics and science instruction, and it called for a higher-quality science and mathematics teaching force as the key to closing the achievement gap. The FSU project is aimed at helping to define key components in educating that teaching force.\nThe Office of Science Teaching Activities in FSU's College of Arts and Sciences and the Center for Integrating Research and Learning at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory both have developed six-week summer programs to give teachers the opportunity to increase their own scientific knowledge and sharpen their skills at teaching science through hands-on research and experimentation. They are joined by a third partner, FSU's College of Education, to determine how effective such professional-development programs are in showing teachers how to implement the \"inquiry learning\" approach called for by such organizations as the National Science Board and the National Academy of Sciences. Inquiry learning uses a child's natural curiosity to develop a greater understanding of scientific concepts; it is generally acknowledged as more effective than traditional classroom approaches such as repetition or rote memorization of \"facts.\"\n\"As the U.S. economy evolves, the demand for workers with strong math and science skills continues to grow,\" said Ellen Granger, director of the Office of Science Teaching Activities and principal investigator on the NSF grant. \"Meanwhile, American students perform relatively poorly in math and science when compared to their peers in other industrialized nations—and the number of Americans pursuing careers in science and engineering has seen a decline. Furthermore, we need a general population that is scientifically literate so that they can understand scientific issues underlying social and political problems and make decisions based on scientifically informed ideas.\"\nGranger's co-investigators on the NSF grant are Patricia J. Dixon, director of the Center for Integrating Research and Learning, and Sherry Southerland, an associate professor of education and program coordinator of the Science Education Program.\n\"For many teachers, this is their first experience in authentic science research,\" Dixon said of the magnet lab's summer program. \"For them to be able to observe, ask questions, and work toward a conclusion to a problem in a laboratory setting goes a long way, we believe, in helping them to develop their students' appreciation for scientific inquiry. How can you teach what you have not had the opportunity to fully come to understand yourself?\"\nSoutherland will seek to identify the essential features of such programs and their influence on teachers' conceptions and use of inquiry teaching. Toward the middle of the five-year study, her focus will shift to the effectiveness of inquiry to support student science learning when compared to the learning of students in classrooms of teachers who lack such training.\n\"We need to learn more about how to structure this type of professional development and about its effects on teachers and their students, so that we in turn can learn to better support teachers in developing the teaching skills that are needed if our students are to become knowledgeable about and capable in science,\" Southerland said.\n\"Collaborative efforts of this nature are crucial to obtain reliable data and determine the direction of the future of education,\" said Marcy P. Driscoll, dean of the College of Education. \"We think this research will be a valuable tool in advancing professional development for teachers in science education and perhaps other areas as well.\"",
    "Multiple sclerosis is a progressive disease for which no cure has yet been found. Researchers are working to identify new and better strategies to stop that progression.\nPeople with primary-progressive MS (read more about courses of MS) experience a slow but nearly continuous worsening of their disease from the onset, with no distinct relapses or remissions. A more common type of progressive MS is secondary-progressive MS, which starts as relapsing-remitting MS and then transitions into a progressive course, with or without occasional relapses.\nSome of the burning questions that are being addressed through research include:\n- What factors influence the transition from a largely relapsing-remitting course with distinct immune attacks to a largely progressive (steadily worsening) course (secondary-progressive MS)?\n- Can the disease-modifying therapies prevent, delay, or slow long-term MS progression?\n- What causes primary-progressive MS, and is it the same (currently unknown) thing that causes more common forms of MS?\n- What new therapies will help people with progressive MS?\n- What causes degeneration of nerve fibers—thought to be the cause of long-term disability experienced by many with MS—and how can that be stopped or reversed?\nAlthough many of the National MS Society’s research studies explore virtually every aspect of MS and more basic aspects of how the nervous system and immune system works, some studies focus specifically on progressive forms of MS. As part of its Strategic Response for 2011-2015, the National MS Society is increasing its focus on understanding mechanisms that drive MS progression and finding new therapies to treat it. Current projects involving people with progressive MS include:\n- Four different teams at Harvard and State University of New York, Buffalo using different methods and approaches to identify possible risk factors that drive progression, some of which may be preventable. Ideally, they will find ways to more quickly identify progressive disease based on biological markers, rather than waiting for symptoms to worsen.\n- A genetics study at Vanderbilt University looking at how variants in a person’s DNA may lead to progressive MS.\n- An imaging study of people with primary-progressive MS at Massachusetts General Hospital aimed at revealing spinal cord damage that is difficult to detect.\n- New York University researchers developing and applying a new way to assess cumulative disability over many functions to provide a tool to improve care and research.\n- MS Tissue Banks that provide shared resources to empower investigations into disease mechanisms.\n- Clinical trials at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, of novel rehabilitation strategies aimed at restoring mobility in people with progressive and advanced MS.

    "From Health Wiki\nAn organic compound that acts as a nutrient in small amounts for organisms, vitamins have various health and beauty benefits for various organisms including humans. A vitamin is determined when the organic chemical compound can’t be synthesized in sufficient amounts by organisms and must be gained from the diet. Certain vitamins are readily available and beneficial to humans while completely useless to animals or plants and so on. There are thirteen vitamins recognized at the present time. Categorized by their biological and chemical activity, vitamins are not defined by their structure, but their biological activity. This biological activity is referred to in the term “vitamin” as it is referencing a number of vitamer compounds that all show the biological activity associated with that specific vitamin. For example, different vitamins have different functions such as vitamin D regulates metabolism and vitamin C acts as an antioxidant.\nVitamin Date of Discovery\n- 1913- Vitamin A (Retinol)\n- 1910- Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)\n- 1920- Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)\n- 1920- Vitamin D (Calciferol)\n- 1920- Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)\n- 1922- Vitamin E (Tocopherol)\n- 1926- Vitamin B12 (Cobalamins)\n- 1929- Vitamin K (Phylloquinone/phytol naphthoquinone)\n- 1931- Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)\n- 1931- Vitamin B7 (Biotin)\n- 1934- Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)\n- 1936- Vitamin B3 (Niacin)\n- 1941- Vitamin B9 (Folic Acid)\nVitamins and minerals are found in a large variety of the foods we consume on a daily basis, some are produced within our body due to outside sources, and some as a bi-product reaction of foods or vitamins we ingest. Each of these vitamins offers a large number of health benefits including but not limited to the prevention numerous diseases, illnesses, infections and conditions such as many types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, and more. Aside from the protection and prevention of many diseases and illnesses, many vitamins also help keep your body balanced by encouraging a healthy metabolism, cell regeneration and normal functioning, and coating the cells of the body to protect from outside invasion of illness or infections. Some vitamins also offer antioxidant benefits, which protect against free radical damage and offer a variety of beauty and health benefits.\nVitamins, when considered in health and beauty, can hold important influence, especially when it comes to the overall health of your eyes, skin, teeth, and hair. Various vitamins provide numerous benefits to your vanity such as vitamin C is a potent antioxidant that protects against free radical damage caused by UV rays and pollution and vitamin A and B3 protect against them as well plus prevent premature aging and reducing or preventing fine lines and wrinkles. Other vitamin benefits include the preservation of eye health and vision, soften and moisturize the skin preventing dry or rough skin problems, prevention of dandruff, eczema or dermatitis, and the formation and normal growth of teeth and bones.\nVitamins, depending on the type, can be found in a variety of food sources such as leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale or lettuce (B vitamins) or in various fruits such as oranges, strawberries and papaya which all contain vitamin C. Vitamin A is found in carrots and other vegetables while vitamin D is offered by milk and sunlight exposure.\nDaily Dose Recommendations\nThe daily dose recommendations vary from vitamin to vitamin and also depend heavily on your age and gender. Please refer to each specific vitamin page for a detailed recommendation on the daily doses according to age and gender.\nMost side effects of vitamins are caused by taking supplements of them in large doses. Although overdose is rare, it can occur if the dosage is too high, but is usually treated by reducing the dosage amount. Side effects of exceeding the dosage amount or symptoms caused by overdose include diarrhea, vomiting and nausea. These symptoms are usually alleviated by lowering the dosage amount. Dosage amounts vary depending on vitamin type, age, health, and gender and should be researched based upon those factors.\nMany vitamin deficiencies are now rare in modern times, but still occur in mostly under developed nations or nations that experience extreme poverty stricken conditions. Deficiencies in various vitamins can lead to a variety of illnesses, conditions, pain, exhaustion and in some cases, death which makes consuming vitamins very important to achieving and living a long and healthy life. Eating plenty of healthy foods, especially fruits and vegetables, daily is important to the prevention of these diseases and conditions caused by vitamin deficiencies.\n- Vitamins Forum\n- Are vitamins toxic?\n- Vitamins and supplements that cancel each other out\n- Vitamin strengths are important\n- Multivitamins dangerous?\n- Importance of B Vitamins",
    "(CNN) — For parents in Somalia, giving their children immunizations is not a choice.\nIn a country enduring more than 20 years of conflict, Somalia is home to one of the highest child mortality rates in the world, with one in five Somali children dying before their 5th birthday, aid agencies say — in many instances, from diseases that could be prevented by vaccines.\nYet for some equally loving parents in the developed world, the messages surrounding childhood vaccination have become muddied. Some communities in areas previously considered disease-free are now falling below the levels of “herd immunity” required to protect against diseases such as measles, whooping cough and mumps.\nThis week, in Swansea, Wales, the local public health agency announced that 886 people have been diagnosed with measles in an epidemic that started in November. The outbreak has been attributed to low measles, mumps and rubella immunization rates. One man’s death has been linked to the measles virus, while 80 people have been hospitalized.\nIn 2011, six people in France died as a result of a measles epidemic that neared 15,000 confirmed cases, according to the World Health Organization.\nTeens not getting vaccinated\nPFCs’ impact on vaccine effectiveness\nStudy: 10% of kids improperly vaccinated\nVaccine schedules for children\nIn 2010, a whooping cough outbreak, resulting from pockets of under-vaccinated people in California, resulted in 10 deaths, according to the California Department of Public Health. Nine of these were infants were too young to be vaccinated.\n“We are extremely concerned about what’s happening in some parts of the developed world,” said Jos Vandelaer, chief of immunization at UNICEF, one of the groups helping vaccination efforts in Somalia. “In the developing world, many people don’t even get the chance to be immunized. Health systems are not strong enough to take the vaccine to every child despite the fact that their parents want it.”\nParents with real fears\nMeasles, whooping cough and Hib (haemophilus influenzae type B), along with many other childhood diseases, can be deadly, but they are vaccine-preventable. Measles alone killed more than 150,000 people globally in 2011, according to WHO.\nMeasles is also highly infectious, with one carrier likely to pass on the virus to between 14 and 18 other susceptible people, said Dr. Matthew Snape of the Oxford Vaccine Group in the pediatrics department at the University of Oxford, England.\nDespite the severity of these diseases, some parents in the developed world choose not to immunize their children and accept the risks.\n“Studies show that it is the upper middle class, well-educated Caucasian parents who are shunning vaccines,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “They have generally gone to graduate school, are in positions of management and are used to being in control.”\nA study released this month by the National Health Performance Authority in Australia reflected this trend. A number of affluent Sydney suburbs were identified as regions where low levels of immunity have put entire communities at risk from these diseases.\nThe reasons behind parents’ decisions are complex. Part of the problem is lingering doubts around vaccine safety that were compounded by a retracted 1998 study linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with autism.\nAlthough declared an “elaborate fraud” by the British Medical Journal, it raised questions about the safety of immunization in the minds of many parents. These doubts then were spread worldwide on the Internet and in the media by anti-vaccination groups and some celebrities.\n“If you want to scare yourself about vaccines, it’s not that hard,” Offit said. “Just turn on your computer.”\nFor such parents, the perceived risks of vaccination outweigh the risks they associate with disease.\nIn Australia, where vaccination is not mandatory, the anti-vaccination Australian Vaccination Network website says parents need to make an informed choice. The site offers links to articles and parental accounts of the potential side effects of many vaccines.\nA UNICEF working paper released this week to coincide with World Vaccination Week has tracked the rise of anti-vaccination sentiment in Eastern and Central Europe and concludes that poorly managed immunization campaigns in some countries have also contributed to the problem.\nConcerned parents in the affected countries are taking to blogs and Facebook, discussing their mistrust of vaccines and government programs, questioning the involvement of pharmaceutical companies and often recommending alternative medicine.\nA March survey conducted by the U.S. organization Public Policy Polling showed that 20% of Americans believe there is a link between childhood vaccines and autism, and a further 34% were not sure.\nDiseases long forgotten in the developed world\nWhile there are some risks associated with vaccines, they are mostly minor, such as pain at the vaccine site or low-grade fever, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A serious allergic reaction is rare and usually reported in less than one out of 1 million doses, the agency reported.\n“Hundreds of millions of children every year are vaccinated, and the number of side effects we see is minimal,” UNICEF’s Vandelaer said. “The anti-vaccine groups focus on the potential side effects, not on the real side effects.”\nOn the question of autism, numerous studies conducted over the past decade have all demonstrated there is no scientific link between vaccines and autism.\nWith so much conflicting information readily available to parents, Dr. Dina Pfeifer, program manager for vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization for WHO’s Europe office, said she believes the decision of whether to immunize children has become so fraught that many parents choose to do nothing at all.\n“They have a difficulty dealing with the amount of information for and against (vaccination) on the Internet, and out of this confusion they are failing to recognize the risks of the disease,” she said.\nAnother factor driving parents’ decision not to vaccinate is the security that comes with herd vaccination, as rates of immunization for many diseases remain above 92% for the population.\nBut Europe’s recent battle with measles demonstrates the problems under-vaccinated populations can pose, especially with older children.\n“Europe had 100,000 cases of measles from 2009 to 2012, and that shows how prevalent the pockets of un-immunized populations are in that area,” Pfeifer said. “Almost 50% of those cases were older than 10 years of age, and the older you are when you contract measles, the more severe the course of the disease.”\nAnother factor of these pockets is their affluence; these parents tend to be the ones able to afford overseas travel.\nIn 2008, a 7-year-old U.S. boy whose parents chose not to immunize him against measles traveled with his family to Switzerland. He caught the virus and returned to San Diego, unknowingly exposing 839 people to the disease and infecting 11 unvaccinated children, according to the journal Pediatrics.\nIn Europe and the United States, parents and most people under 45 have never seen the effects of diseases such as measles, diphtheria or polio.\n“The fear factor (among parents in the developed world) is missing now — the knowledge of what’s on the other side if you don’t have vaccinations,” said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, known as GAVI Alliance.\nThe lack of knowledge of these diseases is also a problem among younger doctors and pediatricians, who may not be able to identify the signs, resulting in misdiagnoses.\n“There is a lot of value in case-based learning, but it is difficult to learn how to recognize these diseases if you haven’t seen them before,” said WHO’s Pfeifer.\nIn contrast, most parents in the developing world, in places such as Somalia, have seen family members suffer, be maimed or die from such diseases, health advocates said.\nEducation and motivation\nTo address the problem, Berkley prescribes localized programs in countries to supplement the already high overall levels of immunization. Other physicians are supporters of parental education and want to ensure parents feel free to ask as many questions of their doctors and health care workers.\nDr. Steve Hambleton of the Australian Medical Association said further motivation may be necessary. “When you incentivize the parents in a meaningful way, whether it be financial or with other incentives, you can make an enormous difference in vaccination uptake,” he said.\nBerkley, a doctor who specializes in epidemiology and global health, said he has seen the devastating effects of vaccine-preventable diseases in war-torn countries and refugee camps.\nBerkley said he wished he could take some parents in the developed world “on a tour, show them how horrible it is. Show them the illness that occurs out of these viruses.”\n“We’ve brought down child mortality dramatically with these vaccination campaigns and we are making dramatic progress, but the challenge is getting people to understand what the world was like before this.”",

    "||Wind dispersal of alpine plant species: A comparison with lowland species|\n||Oliver Tackenberg, Jürg Stöcklin|\n||Journal of Vegetation Science 19: 109-118|\nQuestion: The prominent role of wind dispersal in alpine habitats has been recognized early but has rarely been quantified. The aim of this study is to compare wind dispersal under alpine and lowland conditions and to analyse whether differences are caused by species traits, e.g. terminal velocity of seeds (Vterm) or weather conditions.|\nLocation & Methods: We characterized wind dispersal potential of >1100 Central European species using measured Vterm. To quantify the habitat effect on wind dispersal, we measured meteorological key-parameters and simulated dispersal distance spectra of nine selected species under typical alpine conditions (foreland of the Scaletta-glacier, Switzerland) and typical lowland conditions (grassland near Bad Lippspringe, Germany).\nResults: Lowland species had higher Vterm compared to alpine species. However, this difference disappeared when focusing on species of open habitats. The meteorological measurements showed that the alpine habitat was mainly characterized by higher frequency and strength of updrafts. The simulations showed that under alpine conditions long distance dispersal occurred much more frequent.\nConclusions: More than 50 % of the alpine species have a good chance to be dispersed by wind over long distances, while this proportion is less than 25 % for species from open habitats in the lowland. The more prominent role of wind dispersal in alpine habitats is mainly a result of differences in environmental conditions, namely more intense vertical turbulence in the alpine habitat, and does not result from prominent differences in plant traits, namely Vterm, between alpine and lowland species.\n||dispersal kernel, dispersal strategies, functional ecology, glacier foreland, long distance dispersal, macro-ecology, seed dispersal model, simulation model, terminal velocity, wind dispersal model\n||Jürg Stöcklin: email | webpage | list of publications|",
    "A bicycle is an efficient machine, but only when it's a proper fit. The correct position of the seat, pedals and handlebars in relation to your height, ensure that you enjoy an efficient and enjoyable ride. Because your foot is your body's direct connection for providing motion to the bicycle, proper foot positioning on the pedal is extremely important.\nYou should position your foot over your bicycle pedal so that the ball of your foot, also called the metatarsal, is directly over the pivot arm of the pedal. The pedal's pivot arm is the axis, which runs through the body of the pedal. Positioning your metatarsal over this part of the pedal maximizes stability when bicycling. Practice proper positioning every time you ride, until it you can feel when your foot is out of place on the pedal.\nPlacing your foot properly over the body of the pedal will help to ensure maximum pedal power and efficiency. Positioning the pedal at the ball of your foot promotes a process called \"ankling.\" Ankling to the natural rolling of your foot as it rotates through the crank arms full range of motion. If your foot is farther back on the pedal, you will lose reach and power because your foot cannot rotate properly. If your foot is too far forward, it will place too much pressure on your toes, reducing power and in some cases, causing pain or injury.\nClips And Cages\nCages and clips provide more efficient riding by attaching your foot to the pedal. Cages work by providing a metal or plastic form that fits over your foot and the bike pedal. Adjust the cages' forward position and the tension on your foot to ensure proper alignment. Specially designed biking shoes can clip or snap onto your bicycle pedals. You need to adjust them properly to align the ball of your foot with the pedal's axis.\nProper foot positioning on the pedal is easier when other bicycle fit adjustments are correct. Your foot's position is dictated in large part by your bicycle seat's position. Your should ensure that your seat's height, forward and aft position, and tilt are properly adjusted. When fit correctly, your feet should comfortably reach the pedals throughout your full range of motion.

    "Research and Tracking\nAccurately tracking birth defects is the first step in preventing them and reducing their effect. Birth defects tracking systems are vital to help us find out where and when birth defects occur and who they affect. This gives us important clues about preventing birth defects and allows us to evaluate our efforts.\nWe base our research on what we learn from tracking. By analyzing the data collected, we can identify factors that increase or decrease the risk of birth defects and identify community or environmental concerns that need more study. In addition, research helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) answer critical questions about the causes of many of these birth defects.\nWhat We’ve Learned\nWe know what causes some birth defects, such as Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. However, for about two-thirds of birth defects, the causes are unknown.1 Also, we don’t understand well how certain factors might work together to cause birth defects. While there is still more work to do, we have learned a lot about birth defects through past research. For example:\n- Taking supplements containing folic acid, a B vitamin, at least 1 month before getting pregnant and during pregnancy lowers the risk of having a baby with serious birth defects of the brain and spine (neural tube defects). For this reason, all women who can become pregnant should take supplements containing 400 micrograms of folic acid every day.\n- Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause the baby to be born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Pregnant women should not drink alcohol any time during pregnancy. Women also should not drink alcohol if they are planning to become pregnant or are sexually active and do not use effective birth control.\n- Smoking in the month before getting pregnant and throughout pregnancy increases the chance of premature birth, certain birth defects (such as cleft lip, cleft palate, or both), and infant death. Quitting smoking before getting pregnant is best. However, for women who are already pregnant, quitting as early as possible can still help protect against some health problems.\n- Women who are obese when they get pregnant have a higher risk of having a baby with serious birth defects of the brain and spine (neural tube defects) and some heart defects. Helping women to reach a healthy weight before they get pregnant could prevent birth defects.\n- Poor control of diabetes in pregnant women increases the chance for birth defects, and might cause serious complications for the mother, too. If a woman with diabetes keeps her blood sugar well-controlled before and during pregnancy, she can reduce the chance of having a baby with birth defects.\n- Taking certain medications during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, but the safety of many medications taken by pregnant women has been difficult to determine. If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you should not stop taking medications you need or begin taking new medications without first talking with your doctor. This includes prescription and over-the-counter medications and dietary or herbal products.\nBirth Defects Tracking and Research\nThe Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP)\nMACDP is a population-based tracking system for birth defects among children born to residents of metropolitan Atlanta. Population-based means that the researchers look at all babies with birth defects who live in a defined study area, which is important to get a complete picture of what is happening within this known population. Established in 1967, MACDP was the nation's first population-based system for active collection of information about birth defects. Active data collection means that committed staff members seek out information about birth defects and continually review medical records at multiple health care facilities in a given geographic area. Information obtained from MACDP is used to understand the characteristics of affected children, learn about other health outcomes associated with birth defects, and provide data for education and health policy decisions leading to prevention of birth defects. The system also serves as a model to help other programs develop and implement new tracking methods.\nLearn more about the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) »\nState-Based Tracking Systems\nCDC funds population-based birth defects tracking systems in 14 US states and territories. The tracking systems use the data to help prevent birth defects and to refer infants and children with birth defects to needed services. Identifying birth defects at a state level also strengthens public health officials' ability to estimate prevalence and evaluate risk factors that are the most important in their community. State-based birth defects tracking programs provide important insights into our continued efforts to prevent birth defects and support families affected by them.\nNational Birth Defects Prevention Network (NBDPN)\nCDC supports and collaborates with the NBDPN. The NBDPN is a group of over 225 individuals working at the national, state, and local levels, who are involved in tracking, researching, and preventing birth defects. The NBDPN serves as a forum for exchanging ideas about preventing birth defects for tracking and researching birth defects, and providing technical support for state and local programs. Established in 1997, the NBDPN assesses the effect of birth defects on children, families, and the health care system. It also identifies risk factors for birth defects. This information can be used to develop strategies to prevent birth defects and to assist families and their providers in preventing other disabilities in children with birth defects.\nInternational Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR)\nThe ICBDSR brings together birth defects programs from around the world with the aim of conducting worldwide tracking and research to prevent birth defects and to improve the lives of people born with these conditions. CDC supports and collaborates with the ICBDSR as a way to gain knowledge and expertise on birth defects worldwide and to further our domestic goals and those of the international community.\nEnvironmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT)\nEnvironmental public health tracking is the ongoing collection, integration, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data on environmental hazards, exposures to those hazards, and health effects that may be related to the exposures.\nCDC has worked with representatives from 23 state and local health departments that have received EPHT grants to develop a monitoring system for 12 birth defects. These defects were selected because they are serious birth defects that are relatively easily identified at or around the time of birth, have some potential for environmental risk factors, and could be adequately ascertained by the different types of birth defects tracking systems. The EPHT Network tracks the prevalence of these defects and publishes annual data tables and maps in the national portal. Currently, the national portal has birth defects data for Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Utah, and Wisconsin.\nNational Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS)\nEstablished in 1997, NBDPS is the largest population-based U.S. study looking at risk factors and potential causes of over 30 major birth defects. CDC funds the study and collects data with researchers from other study sites, collectively called the Centers for Birth Defects Research and Prevention (CBDRP). Participating sites have included Arkansas, California, Georgia (CDC), Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas, and Utah.\nUnderstanding the potential causes of birth defects can help us learn how to prevent them. The NBDPS has made key contributions in understanding the risk of specific medications when used just before and during pregnancy. Data from the NBDPS has also clearly demonstrated that maternal obesity is a strong risk factor for a number of major birth defects and has confirmed the association between maternal smoking and orofacial clefts. The NBDPS is one key step toward bringing us to a day when fewer babies are born with birth defects.\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nNHANES is a nationally-representative survey designed to look at the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations, including the collection of blood samples.\nCDC uses information from these studies to look at the amount of folic acid taken in from food and dietary supplements. Green vegetables, fruits, and juices have natural folate, and other foods, such as cereal and bread, have folic acid added to them. CDC is looking at NHANES data to see how people get folic acid and to see if they are getting the recommended amount. This information will help determine if adding different levels of folic acid to these foods or different types of foods would affect peoples’ intake. CDC is also using these data to look at folic acid intake and blood folate concentrations among women who are pregnant, or who may become pregnant, as well as specifically among women who are obese or who have diabetes. CDC also uses NHANES data to look at patterns of prescription medication use among pregnant women. This information will help determine the most commonly used medications during pregnancy, which CDC will use to identify medications that need future research to characterize their safety or risk during pregnancy.\n- Nelson K, Holmes LB. 1989.

    "NASA's Curiosity rover will try risky landing near Mount Sharp\nSpace agency confident it can dodge mountainous Mars obstacle\nNASA has decided to up the ante for the Mars rover Curiosity's arrival next month by pushing the landing site nearer to the foot of an inconvenient mountain.\nThe old and new landing targets for Curiosity. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ESA/DLR/FU Berlin/MSSS\nObviously an obstacle like a mountain makes setting down a bit dicier, but the space agency is going to risk it so that the rover will be able to get to where it wants to be months earlier.\n\"We're trimming the distance we'll have to drive after landing by almost half,\" Peter Theisinger, Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) project manager, said in a canned statement.\nNASA is more confident that the precision landing tech on the MSL, which is carrying Curiosity, can aim closer without hitting the forebodingly named Mount Sharp at the centre of the Gale crater because it will be using a new version of flight software uploaded to the travelling craft in the last two weeks.\nThe previous landing target zone for the MSL was around 12 miles (19km) wide and 16 miles (26km) long. The new narrower zone is just four miles wide (6.4km) and 12 miles (19km) long.\n\"We have been preparing for years for a successful landing by Curiosity, and all signs are good,\" Dave Lavery, MSL programme executive, said.\n\"However, landing on Mars always carries risks, so success is not guaranteed. Once on the ground we'll proceed carefully. We have plenty of time since Curiosity is not as life-limited as the approximate 90-day missions like NASA’s Mars Exploration Rovers and the Phoenix lander.”\nCuriosity is due to touch down on the Red Planet at 15.31 GMT on 5 August (08.31 PST) to start its two-year mission to find out if Mars has ever or could ever support life. More upgrades for its surface ops are due to be beamed to the rover a week after landing. ®",
    "In carrying out research on all three areas, a large measure of scepticism is necessary with regard to the dates of births, marriages and deaths reported by family members before 1900. This is especially true for births; the ages given in census returns, for example, are almost always inaccurate, and round figures - 50. 60, 70, - should be treated with particular caution. The true date of birth is almost always well before the one reported, sometimes by as much as fifteen years. Why this should be so is a matter for speculation, but it seems unlikely that vanity or mendacity are to blame. It would appear more probable that, up to the start of this century, very few people actually knew their precise date of birth. Since, at least after middle age, almost no-one feels as old as they actually are, a guess will usually produce an underestimate. Whatever the explanation, charitable or otherwise, it is always wiser to search a range of the indexes before the reported date, rather than after.\n[Click for larger image]\nFrom 1864 to 1877 the indexes consist of a single yearly volume in each category - births, marriages and deaths - covering the entire country, and recording all names in a straightforward alphabetical arrangement. The same arrangement also applies to the non-Catholic marriages registered from 1845.\nFrom 1878, the yearly volume is divided into four quarters, with each quarter covering three months and indexed separately.\nThis means that a search for a name in, for example, the 1877 births index involves looking in one place in the index, while it is necessary to check four different places in the 1878 index, one in each of the four quarters. From 1903, in the case of births only, the indexes once again cover the entire year, and only from this year also supply the mother's maiden surname.\nIn all three categories, each index entry gives\nThe \"volume and page number\" simply make up the reference for the original register entry, necessary in order to obtain a photocopy of the full information given in that entry.",
    "Commemorated on November 13th\nSt John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople\nSt John (407 AD), who since the sixth century has been called Chrysostom or golden mouthed, was born in Antioch of a noble Christian family between 344 and 354 AD. He was brought up by his widowed mother and received the best education which Antioch could offer. He studied philosophy under Andragathius, rhetoric under the celebrated Libanius, and theology under Diodore of Tarsus. He became a monk by 375 and lived in a mountain community not far from Antioch. He nearly ruined his health through austerities and the damp conditions of his cave hermitage. He returned to Antioch in 381, was ordained deacon by Bishop Meletius, and served the local church until his ordination as priest in 386 by Bishop Flavian, the successor of Meletius. He then became the bishop's special assistant, particularly for the temporal care and spiritual instruction of the numerous Christian poor of the city.\nSt John soon distinguished himself a preacher and commentator on the Epistles of St Paul and the Gospels of Matthew and John (386-397). He insisted in the Antiochene tradition on the literal meaning of Holy Scripture and its practical application to the problems of the time. Hence much of his work has relevance today also.\nIn 397 AD, after the death of Archbishop Nectarius of Constantinople, Emperor Arcadius wished St John to be chosen in his place. An envoy was sent to secretly detach John from Antioch, for fear of popular opposition. Theophilus, Archbishop of Alexandria consecrated him on February 398. John was the somewhat unwilling recipient of episcopal consecration at the hands of the at least equally unwilling Theophilus.\nAs Metropolitan of Constantinople, John immediately set about a much needed reform of the court, clergy and laity. He reduced the customary spending of his own household in favour of the poor and hospitals. He enacted severe discipline for the clergy and attacked the behaviour, the clothes, and the make-up of the women at court. He also criticised those Christians who had been to the races on Good Friday and to the games in the stadium on Holy Saturday.\nIn 401 AD, at a synod in Ephesius, he deposed six bishops, with the result that all forces opposed to him, at home and abroad, consolidated in a united effort to destroy him. The Empress Eudoxia regarded his drive for moral reform as a personal attack on herself. Meanwhile Theophilus made common cause with the empress and organised a cabal of 36 bishops, which assembled at Chalcedon in 403, as the Synod of the Oak.\nThe synod condemned St John unheard. He was charged on a series of more or less false charges, was also accused of treason for calling Eudoxia 'Jezebel', was dropped from his see, and asked for his banishment. Arcadius exiled John to Bithynia, but an earthquake in Constantinople terrified him and he recalled John the next day. John resumed his plain speaking, which again enraged Eudoxia; Theophilus intrigued against him with appeals to an Arian council of Antioch, and John was again banished, this time for resuming the duties of a see from which he had been 'lawfully deposed'. This took place on June 9, 404 AD; although his own people and many bishops supported him, he was exiled, first to Curusus in Armenia, where he remained three years, and then to Pontus, where he was killed by enforced travel in bad weather, on foot and in spite of repeated pleas of exhaustion. He died on September 14, 407 AD. Thirty-one years later his body was taken back to Constantinople and reburied in the church of the Apostles.",
    "As can be expected, more kids than ever are getting their first cell phone in the ages between 12 and 17, but what are the unintended consequence of this?\nMany of these phones have web browsers on them, and that means teens have greater access to the Internet and less monitoring by mom and dad.\nIn the past, kids would get on the home computer and surf the web. Parents could then check the history of their page visits or block certain sites. Now, with smartphones, it's tougher to keep track of what they are looking up.\nA new report from the Pew Internet & American Life Project finds 78 percent of young people, ages 12 to 17, now have cell phones. Nearly half of those are smartphones.\nThe survey, released Wednesday, finds one in four young people say they are \"cell-mostly\" Internet users -- a percentage that increases to about half when the phone is a smartphone. That number towers over the only 15 percent of adults who say they access the Internet mostly by cell phone.\nThe question for parents is how to track and manage what your kids can do on their cell phone? Well, many of these phones have restriction menus allowing parents to block certain functions or mature web sites.\nCell phone providers also have services so parents can see a log of their children's texts. And there are a growing number of smartphone applications that at least claim to give parents some level of control on a phone's web browser, though many tech experts agree that these applications can be hit-or-miss.\nPew researchers have found many parents hesitate to confiscate phones as punishment because they want their kids to stay in contact with them.\n\"Adults are still trying to work out the appropriate rules for themselves, let alone their children,\" co-author of this research Mary Madden says. \"It's a difficult time to be a parent.\"",
    "FISHING FORECAST TAKES GUESS WORK OUT OF WHERE TO FISH\nFeb. 14, 2013\nAnglers use fishing forecast to find hidden opportunities\nPRATT – The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWPT) 2013 Fishing Forecast features the ins and outs of fish populations in public waters around the state, helping anglers to better decide where to cast their lines. Comprised of sampling efforts conducted during annual lake monitoring, the fishing forecast gives anglers detailed information on the best bodies of water to fish for their specific fishing needs.\nThe data collected is divided into three categories based on the size of the body of water sampled. Reservoirs are defined as bodies of water larger than 1,200 acres, lakes are defined as bodies of water from 10 to 1,200 acres, and bodies of water smaller than 10 acres are defined as ponds. Since not every lake is sampled each year, the forecast provides a three-year average of each location to provide anglers with the best available information.\nIn addition to what species of fish can be caught at any given body of water, the fishing forecast also includes tables with a Density Rating, Preferred Rating, Lunker Rating, Biggest Fish (the largest fish sampled), Biologist’s Rating and the previously-mentioned Three-Year Average of popular species.\nThe Density Rating is the number of fish that were high-quality size or larger sampled per unit of sampling effort. High-quality size, listed in parentheses at the top of the Density Rating column, is the length of fish considered acceptable to most anglers and is different for each species. The higher the Density Rating, the more high-quality-sized or larger fish per surface acre in the lake. Theoretically, a lake with a Density Rating of 30 has twice as many high-quality-sized fish per acre as a lake with a Density Rating of 15.\nThe Preferred Rating identifies how many above-average-sized fish a water contains. For example, a lake may have a good density of crappie, but few fish over 10 inches. The Preferred Rating tells an angler where to go to for a chance to catch bigger fish.\nThe Lunker Rating is similar to the Density Rating, but it tells you the relative density of lunker-sized fish in the lake. A lunker is a certain length of fish considered a trophy by most anglers. It also differs with each species and is listed in parentheses at the top of the Lunker Rating column. For example, most anglers consider a channel catfish longer than 28 inches a lunker. Many lakes may have a lunker rating of 0, but this does not mean there are no big fish in that lake. It just means that no lunker fish were caught during sampling, and they may be less abundant than in lakes with positive Lunker Ratings.\nYou can use the Density Rating and Lunker Rating together. If you want numbers, go with the highest Density Rating. If you want only big fish, go with the Lunker Rating. Somewhere in the middle might be a better choice. A lake with a respectable rating in all three categories will provide the best overall fishing opportunities.\nThe Biggest Fish column lists the weight of the largest fish caught during sampling. A heavy fish listed here can give the lunker fishermen confidence that truly big fish are present.\nThe Biologist’s Rating adds a human touch to the forecast. Each district fisheries biologist reviews the data from annual sampling of their assigned lakes. This review considers environmental conditions that may have affected the sampling. They also consider previous years’ data. A rating of P (poor), F (fair), G (good), or E (excellent) will be in the last column. Sometimes the Density Rating may not agree with the Biologist’s Rating. This will happen occasionally and means the Density Rating may not accurately reflect the biologist’s opinion of the fishery.\nThe Three-Year Average rating refers to the averaging of the Density Rating over the previous three years of sampling to help show a trend for a particular lake.\nWhether anglers are simply looking for a new spot to cast, or are searching for that elusive trophy fish, the 2013 Fishing Forecast is an invaluable tool for any fisherman.\nA copy of this year’s forecast can be found in the March/April issue of Kansas Wildlife and Parks magazine, any KDWPT office or license vendor.",
    "The length of amyloid fibrils found in diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson appears to play a role in the degree of their toxicity, according to researchers at the University of Leeds. Their findings are published in The Journal of Biological Chemistry in a paper titled “Fibril Fragmentation Enhances Amyloid Cytotoxicity.”\nSheena Radford, Ph.D., and colleagues systematically analyzed the effects of fragmentation on three of the 30 or so proteins that form amyloid in human diseases. Their results showed that in addition to the expected relationship between fragmentation and the ability to seed, the length of fibrils also correlated with their ability to disrupt membranes and reduce cell viability. This was evident even when there were no other changes in molecular architecture.\nCo-author, Eric Hewitt, Ph.D., says that while the findings provide scientists with unexpected new insights for the development of therapeutics against amyloid deposit-related diseases, the next stage of research will involve looking at a greater numbers of the proteins that form amyloid fibrils. “We anticipate that when we look at amyloid fibers formed from other proteins, they may well follow the same rules.”\n“It may be that because they’re smaller it’s easier for them to infiltrate cells,” Dr. Hewitt suggests. “We’ve observed them killing cells, but we’re not sure yet exactly how they do it. Nor do we know whether these short fibers form naturally when amyloid fibers assemble or whether some molecular process makes them disassemble or fragment into shorter fibers. These are our next big challenges.”",
    "My immigrant ancestor, Nicanor Gonzalo Sanchez-Tereso was born on 10 January 1791 in Herencia, Spain. He married Anna Marie Weber in 1815 in Bad Kreuznach, Germany. They had at least 7 children in between 1819 and 1833 while living in Germany. They immigrated to the US after the revolution and ended up settling in Keokuk county, IA. Sadly, they both died a couple of years after arriving.\nI decided that I wanted to learn a bit more about the town of Herencia, where the Sanchez-Tereso family lived for at least a couple of hundred years. Nicanor’s ancestor, Juan Sanchez Tereso, was born there in 1620. (Related families that also lived in this area were: Gomez-Lobo, Lopez-Naranjo, Fernandez-Canadas, Martinez-Ojeda, Rodriguez-Polanco, Martinez-Oxeda, Garcia-Navas, Rodriguez Del Tembleque, Diaz De Ubeda, Martinez-Viveros and many more hyphenated names!)\nHerencia is in the Province of Ciudad Real in the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, about 150 km south of Madrid. It has about 9,000 inhabitants. Fairly small.\nI found a couple of websites for Herencia: www.herencia.net and www.herencia.es. The first seems to have more local news/events. The second had information on history, a map of the town, and pictures.\nI had to use Google Translate to figure out what the sites said. I have taken Russian, German, and a little French, but Spanish is an absolute mystery to me. The words were translated so that I could get the gist of it, but it just sounded awkward. It’s much better than pulling out a dictionary though, isn’t it? I won’t complain.\n- Herencia is translated as “Heritage” or “Legacy” (according to Google Translate). Now, isn’t that a cool name for a town?\n- In 1239, after the Battle of Los Navas de Tolosa, the Kingdom of Castile began the repopulation of the Southern Plateau. The town of Herencia is given its charter. It has about 150 residents at this time.\n- In 1568, a granary was built.\n- They had vineyards and produced a lot of wine.\n- In 1604, there is a population crisis because of poor harvests and typhoid epidemics.\n- In 1786 there was an epidemic of malaria. Life expectancy at this time period was about 50.\n- In 1790, the first of the windmills was built. By the early 1800′s, there were 11 windmills in/around Herencia.\n- I love this translation: “In 1,798, the master of the alphabet, D. Alfonso García Rosel, teaches 90 children of all ages, including 12 of the poorest, who do not receive any money.” I wonder if my Nicanor (who was born in 1791) may have been one of these children.\n- In 1808, they record that there are only 3 remaining windmills. It says that this may be due to the destruction by French troops during the War for Independence.\nI also found a site that has an album of pictures from the area. Lots of windmills, reminiscent of Don Quixote. Actually, the setting of Don Quixote is in this vicinity. It was neat to see what the area looks like. I would love to visit someday!!\nHere is a translation of what the Herencia.es site had to say about the relation of Don Quixote to the area:\nIf the heirs of Cervantes had to collect intellectual property rights for the use of the names mentioned in Don Quixote, his would be one of the largest fortunes. In Legacy there is no corner that does not contain any reference to Cervantes’s fiction, from the stamp of their handmade cheeses, until the inevitable street and Plaza Cervantes. The very name of the people is in itself a valuable legacy.It is best to walk to the Plaza of Spain, where is the Church of the Immaculate Conception, then visit the Church of Our Lady of Mercy and walk the streets, that have a certain symmetry, with white as dominant color of the cityscape.. At the time of rest and food it is essential the presence of cheese Inheritance of universal popularity. Surely there will be no better place to buy a manchego cheese and taste\nThe most exciting thing that I found is a bit of information on the church where my ancestors attended: the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The church that is currently standing was built in the 18th century, which means that it is the same one that Nicanor and his family attended.\nI have added visiting this place as number 153 on my life list.\nOther questions I have about this area are: How was it affected by the Napoleonic Wars? This is the time period that Nicanor (later known as Nicholas) was living there. He would have been 16 when the Peninsular War started and 23 when it ended. Was he a soldier? Would he have gone to Germany as a soldier? Did he move there after the war, looking for a new life? He married in 1815 in Germany, after the wars ended.\nI really know very little about this time period/place. I think that I only briefly studied it in high school and obviously didn’t retain anything. Everything I know about the Napoleonic Era was learned from watching BBC movies and reading Jane Austen novels.Not a complete education, for sure.\nLuckily, we will be studying Napoleon and the world in his time this January in our homeschool. Hopefully I will learn something too! I have a wonderful book entitled Historical Atlas of the Napoleonic Era. It has so many wonderful maps and paintings in it. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a book on this time period. I’m obviously not an expert though.\nI looked at the map of Spain in the chapter titled “The Spanish Ulcer”, and there was definitely chaos all around where the Sanchez-Tereso’s were living. Even if they didn’t fight in the wars, they had to be affected by the things going on around them. Another thing I need to research is Nicanor’s siblings. Other than their birth and baptismal dates, I know absolutely nothing about them. Did they stay in Spain or did they move also?\nI wonder if there are records of soldiers for this time period. Hmm. Things to think about. Any suggestions on where to look for further information?

    "What is a Mediator?:\nHeavy court caseloads and rising legal costs have prompted many people to settle their legal disputes outside the courtroom through a process known as alternative dispute resolution (ADR). Mediators, also known as arbitrators and conciliators, guide the ADR process and help resolve conflicts between disputing parties.\nJob Duties of Mediators:\nMediators facilitate negotiation and settlement between disputing parties by providing direction and encouragement, working collaboratively with the parties and finding creative ways to reach a mutual solution. Specific duties vary widely depending upon practice setting but may include facilitating discussion and controlling the direction of negotiations; preparing court reports, social case histories, correspondence and other documents; implementing legislative enactments and court rules relating to a case; and keeping abreast of current trends, rules and legislation.\nAlthough many mediators are lawyers and former judges, non-lawyers from all backgrounds are entering the profession. To date, no formal licensing or certification process exists in the U.S. for mediators. Training for mediators is available through independent mediation programs, national and local mediation membership organizations, and postsecondary schools, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Colleges and universities in the United States are beginning to offer advanced degrees in dispute resolution and conflict management.\nSuperior communication, negotiation, problem-solving, analytical and conflict resolution skills are essential. Mediators must have the ability to maintain confidences, exercise sound judgment and discretion, work collaboratively with others and foster effective working relationships with clients, courts, judicial staff, community agencies and the general public. In addition to a high level of competence, successful mediators are intuitive and able to help meet their clients’ emotional needs. Neutrality, honesty, creativity and patience are also crucial to the mediator’s role.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, earnings for mediators range from $28,090 to $102,202 per year with median annual wages estimated at $49,490. Hourly rates range from a low of $13.50 to a high of $49.05 with a median hourly wage estimated at $23.80. Most mediators are employed by the state and local government, schools and universities, legal service providers, insurance carriers and corporations.\nAs individuals and businesses seek to avoid the delays, publicity and high costs inherent in litigation, alternative dispute resolution is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to lawsuits. As a result, mediators are expected to experience above average growth in employment.\nThe American Arbitration Association and the American Bar Association Section for Dispute Resolution provide a wealth of information relating to the dispute resolution field.Mediate.com maintains a list of international, national and state conflict resolution organizations.",
    "“Social media is only going to be persuasive and become such a critical factor in the success of failure in business.”\nToday, word of mouth is changed by social networking site and internet. We share things to more people today because of social networking sites and internet, news spread faster, and people will gain more insight because the tendency to read more.\nWith the ability to connect to massive crowd, a person has the ability to impact other people and influence them in making decisions. In 2007, 78% of people trust the recommendations of other consumers; while only 14% of people trust advertisement. But now that number has increased as in 2009, 90% of people trust the recommendations of other consumers more. (Nielsen, 2009).\nIt is great to see that today, more and more companies are embracing all types of social networking to get most of people’s attention. But, we can’t treat social media platform like conventional media. One must be engaged and be active. We can’t just put information like we did in conventional media to social media platform. It works differently. Participation is the fundamental of social media, because the whole point of social media is to share and create information for others to participate, not just to spread and read it.\nIn order for the social networking to be effective, one must engage and interact with them. Danny Oei Wirianto, online marketing entrepreneur said that one of the most common mistakes marketers made in this regard was to create a Facebook fan page simply to collect as many friends as possible, while failing to really communicate with those people.\nSocial media is not a replacement for conventional media, thus we can’t treat it like that. Like it or not, the future will shift towards more sharing and creating content. Content is the new democracy. But because there are still people that have not engaged in this medium, social media has not revealed its full power yet.",
    "The Indian Ocean is their ball room floor, the wind and the waves the music to which they have been dancing since as early as 600 BC. They are the numerous dugout canoes and dhows seen plying the waters of the ocean near Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar.\nWatching the dhows from the shore sailing slowly and elegantly past with lateen sails billowing in the wind, I could almost hear the sound of a slow beautiful waltz as they seemed to dance with the wind and the sea in perfect harmony.\nOn another day when the wind and the waves were stronger I imagined a fast tango with the wind hugging the sail tightly and the Dhow bending and dipping in harmony with the rhythm of the sea and the wind.\nThe smaller dhows rigged with outboard engines and used to ferry passengers and tourists to and from the surrounding islands and sandbanks, reminded me of teenagers dancing a fast jig, excited about life and all it still holds in store for them.\nThen there were the small dugout canoes which we saw lying forlornly and alone on the shore below the jetty at Slipway in Dar es Salaam. They were waiting with their nets drying in the sun like wall flowers sitting at the side of the ballroom floor. Waiting for a new day to dawn, heralding a fishing trip at sea where they could dance their unique slow dance in tune with waves, the wind and the fisherman.\nDug out canoes are usually made out of one tree such as a mango tree and are mostly used to fish in shallow sheltered waters by a single fisherman.\nDhow is the name for a number of sailing vessels using one or more lateen sails. Dhows usually have long thin hulls and are mainly used as trading vessels, carrying heavier merchandise such as fruit and fresh water along the East African coast. The local trading dhows use an outboard engine mainly for maneuvring, while the main means of propulsion still is the sail. Fishing boats also use their engine when actually engaged in fishing with nets.\nThese canoes as well as traditional dhows are still manufactured in the Nungwi region of Zanzibar and north of Stone Town at the edge of a mangrove rimmed inlet.\nI salute these age old seagoing vessels and their crew. May this tradition live long as it adds a certain romance and magic to a visit to these regions.",
    "Modern surgical techniques have come a long way in recent years. Fiber optics allow ear surgeons to perform delicate operations that would have been unheard of just decades ago. One of the most common procedures is known as myringotomy (MERE-IN-JOT-OH-ME), an operation that involves making a small hole in the eardrum and passing a tube through to drain excess fluid from the middle ear. It's particularly useful in treating children with ear infections. While many hearing disorders can be treated with antibiotics or other drugs, surgery may still be necessary in extreme cases. Most ear surgery is now considered to be both simple and safe. See an ear, nose and throat specialist when you detect the first sign of hearing loss, dizzy spells or other symptoms of ear ailments. If surgery is necessary, the doctor will explain the procedure.",
    "In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added folic acid to the list of vitamins and minerals added to the nation's food supply. The intent was to prevent devastating neural tube birth defects, which previously afflicted as many as 1 in 1,000 newborns.\nThe Role of Folic Acid in Fetal Development\nStudies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established that 50% to 70% of neural tube abnormalities, which produce profound and sometimes fatal neurologic defects, can be prevented by ensuring that pregnant women get enough folic acid daily. Women who are planning to become pregnant should start taking a supplement containing 400 to 800 micrograms of folic acid every day. Women should start taking it at least 1 month before conception and continue it for the first 3 months of pregnancy. Without supplementation, most women would fall short of the mark.\nPublic health officials reasoned that if the vitamin were added to grain products, such as flour, pasta, bread and breakfast cereals, women would get more of the folic acid they need, when they need it. But there was much debate about how much folic acid could be safely added to food.\nIn a compromise, the FDA decided to limit the amount of folic acid added to food. A bowl of breakfast cereal, for instance, provides only about 0.1 milligram. Most women of childbearing age do not consume enough folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. All women of childbearing age should take a vitamin containing at least 0.4 milligrams of folic acid.\nFolic Acid in Food\nSupplements aren't the only way to make sure you get plenty of this important B vitamin.

    "Juvenile striped bass spawned in the Chesapeake Bay were at a record low at the end of the summer. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources recently completed its annual young of the year survey and found far fewer juvenile fish than a year ago.\nScientists believe the factors are more tied to unusually warm weather conditions in the Chesapeake than to the number of adult fish spawning in the bay.\nThe annual survey of fish spawned in the summer is called the young of the year index, and is used to gauge the health of stocks born in that year. The annual index, collected over more than 50 years, has had many highs and lows. This year’s index, the lowest recorded, was.89. Last year’s index of 11.9 was the fourth highest.\nNearly all striped bass found in Vineyard waters come from the Chesapeake. It can take from four to six years for a female striped bass to reach sexual maturity.\nDan McKiernan, deputy director of the state Division of Marine Fisheries, called the low index troubling and said it may be tied to environmental factors, since the water temperature in Chesapeake Bay was especially high this summer. Mr. McKiernan said the number of adults spawning in the bay didn’t change that much from last year. He said the index shows how well those juvenile fish survived by the end of the summer, not how many fish were spawned.\n“What it tells you is that there is high variability. You see a swinging pendulum. I am not a climatologist, but it would seem that the wild swings are tied to the environment,” Mr. McKiernan said. “Whether you look at the temperature of the water or the amount of rainfall, you’ve got dramatic swings... the Chesapeake Bay had one of the hottest years,” he added.\nMike Armstrong, a fisheries biologist and assistant director of the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, underscored the significance of the striped bass fishery. “It is the recreational fishery in Massachusetts,” he said. “We live and die by the health of striped bass, so we are watching the stocks like hawks.”\nThe Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, a regional government agency, has been monitoring the striped bass fishery closely since stocks collapsed 30 years ago. Recently, the commission decided to take steps to tighten controls on management of the fishery.\nThe abundance of striped bass is not determined by a single year class, Mr. Armstrong said, but by watching larger trends. “We are not pushing the panic button. But if we have three years in a row like this, then we push the panic button,” the fisheries biologist said.\nAlso, new trends were observed this summer. Mr. Armstrong said fishermen saw many more schoolie-sized striped bass in Massachusetts waters than would normally be expected.\nHe said scientists are wondering whether the large 2011 year class still swimming in the Chesapeake Bay had something to do with the change by pushing the larger juvenile fish out into the Atlantic.\nJanet Messineo of Vineyard Haven, an avid fisherman and past president of the Martha’s Vineyard Surfcasters Association, confirmed the trend from her experience fishing the derby this fall. “There were more small fish out there,” she said. “We should be concerned [about the low index] but I think we really need to make sure that the fish are in a healthy ecosystem,” she added. “Right from the get-go, we should be thinking of the bait, from microorgansims to bunker [menhaden, a valuable bait fish that has been characterized as overfished and in need of restoration]. We cannot go crazy over just one species. We have to look at the whole picture if we want a healthy fishery.”\nShe continued: “The good thing I saw [this year] was that there were bunker. I haven’t seen bunker in a lot of years. One of the problems with striped bass we’ve seen in the past is that they were skinny and emaciated. This year we saw healthier fish. My concern isn’t that there be a large number of fish out there. I think we should be concerned that they have food to eat.”",

    "Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound during breathing. It occurs when air moves through narrowed breathing tubes.\nWheezing is a sign that a person may be having breathing problems.

    "Chest-mounted electronics do a more accurate job of counting heart beats than do optical sensors on the wrist. That’s one of the conclusions to come out of a close look at this sport watch aimed at runners.\nA sport watch from Garmin called the Forerunner 220 is basically a runner’s watch that tracks distance and pace via GPS. It can connect to a smart phone to work with a cloud-based service for things like social media sharing and keeping track of progress toward goals. It also records your heart rate, though a method differing from that employed in sport watches from Fitbit.\nOn a Fitbit watch, the heart rate sensor is an optical sensor that monitors blood flow through the wrist as a way of detecting heart beats. The problem is that the wrist has less tissue, more bones, and more tendons than other parts of the body so there isn’t real good blood flow there. Consequently, the accuracy of heart beat readings read optically can be suspect, particularly for those who work out hard enough to get a heart rate above 160 beats per minute. Then the blood is passing the sensor pretty fast and there tends to be a lot of body movement as well because you’re exercising hard. And it becomes really difficult to get an accurate reading.\nBut the Garmin Forerunner doesn’t have that problem because it uses a different kind of heart beat monitor. The heart beat monitor is separate from the watch. It takes the form of a sensor on a strap that goes around the chest. Unlike in the Fitbit, the sensor doesn’t monitor blood flow. Like an EKG machine, it uses the fact that the heart generates an electrical signal as it beats. And this EKG activity can be detected through the skin.\nHowever, there is a big difference between the functions of a conventional EKG machine and the sensor on the Garmin chest strap. When doctors look at an EKG display, they are keenly interested in the shape of the heartbeat. So EKG electronics contains super-sensitive instrumentation amplifiers and filters to let them record the shape of the beat accurately. But the heart beat monitor that works with the Garmin watch merely needs to count the beats. It doesn’t care about their shape. So it can be much simpler.\nIt is interesting to see the way the chest strap incorporates electrodes for heart beat monitoring. For conventional EKG tests, there are generally three contact points on the patient’s skin. The Garmin chest monitor, too, contains electrodes, but they are disguised. They take the form of the two snaps that attach the monitor to the strap. It looks like the snaps are there so you can remove the monitor to change the battery or to clean the strap. In reality, the snaps are also the electrodes.\nThis dual-use of the snaps explains why the strap must be worn next to your skin: so electrodes can make contact. When we pulled the monitor apart, we found small contacts that touched the snaps and bridged them to the inputs of a TI microcontroller. That connection is interesting because conventional EKG electronics usually contains a special chip that serves as a front-end to the EKG measurement. This chip usually contains an instrumentation amplifier and specialized circuits for managing the heart rate data.\nIn contrast, the Garmin chest monitor circuit contains none of that. The electrodes seem to just feed straight into the TI microcontroller without much other filtering or signal processing. We did find a few general-purpose transistors on the monitor board, some of which might be there to boost the heart rate signal, which can be on the order of tens of microvolts.\nThe low-level nature of the electrode signals might help explain the presence of what seem to be Zener diodes on the heart rate monitor board. We suspect they might be there in case a voltage gets applied to the two electrodes that is significantly higher than tens of microvolts. The zeners could conceivably act to limit the input voltage so it doesn’t somehow destroy the circuitry on the heart monitor board that’s set up to just work with microvolt-level signals.\nOnce the heart rate monitor detects a heart rate, it sends that information to the watch via Bluetooth. The chest monitor contains a widely-used Bluetooth chip from Nordic Semiconductor for that purpose. We also found a linear regulator made by Texas Instruments. There’s also a quarter-inch-long mystery device containing four terminals whose markings didn’t come back to anything on any of our Google searches.\nInside the watch\nThe watch itself uses an LCD which attaches to the circuit board with a flex connector. There are three eight-pin chips near the display connector which we surmise are display driver chips, though we can’t be sure because their markings aren’t definitive.\nNext to the display connector is the Nordic BLE chip that communicates with the heart monitor and with a smart phone for uploading performance data to the cloud. Several components reside inside a metal shield. Closest to the display drivers is a low-power microcontroller from Texas Instruments. We might surmise that this processor is handling the display and other housekeeping chores on the watch.\nThe more complicated tasks, say, managing the GPS data, seem to be handled by a 120 MHz ARM Cortex M4 device from NXP that sits above the TI chip. Between the two processors are four Pericom four-bit level shifters that provide 16 bits of level shifting.\nThe presence of the level shifters is interesting. A level shifter connects one digital circuit that uses one logic level to another digital circuit that uses another logic level. But in this case, their presence is a bit of a mystery. They sit between the two processors which leads to the possibility that they are manipulating signals passing between the two. But it is not clear why: Both the TI processor and the NXP device are CMOS parts, so they both use CMOS logic levels. And they both work from the same power supply — the coin cell in the watch. So the reason for 16-bits-worth of level shifting isn’t readily apparent.\nBesides the processors, there is a flash memory chip from Macronix that is a 32-megabit serial device. Near it resides a chip from Linear Technology that both manages the charging of the lithium-ion battery and regulates the overall use of power on the board. The location of the power manager IC is interesting: Designers chose to enclose it in the same metal shield that contains the processors and memory. But there’s no obvious need to put this chip inside a metal shield, so its presence there is noteworthy.\nAdditionally, a separate section of the board has its own separate metal shield. That section houses the GPS circuits. There are two main chips and a crystal oscillator in that section, plus a small chip we could identify. The big chip is a GPS receiver from Mediatek, a company in Taiwan that mostly makes chips for cell phones. Next to it is a GPS front-end chip from Infineon. The front-end chip does some filtering of the incoming GPS signal and amplifies it before it gets to the GPS receiver.\nThe reverse side of the watch PCB is less interesting. The 150 mA-h lithium-ion battery attaches to this side of the board. The only other major component is the vibration motor. It rotates an eccentric mass to provide a sort of buzzing for an alarm or haptic feedback.\nAll in all, Garmin’s watch is an example of what many IoT devices are likely to look like inside the package.\nMSP430F5310 TI controller",
    "Navigating the Mississippi River\nThe amazing river of Mark Twain and Huck FinnHistory\nNext to the Missouri, the Mississippi is the longest river in the United States. As settlers started their westward migration, navigating the Mississippi became an integral part of American history. Originally under the control of both the Spanish and French, the river was part of the vast Louisiana Purchase in 1803.\nThe river was an important aspect of Native American life and culture, and its name is believed to have come from words meaning “great river” or “great water.” French fur traders plied the river with keelboats and rafts, which were followed by the advent of steamboats in 1811. The first bridge across the Mississippi was constructed in 1855 in Minneapolis. While much of the traffic ceased during the Civil War, the river was an important invasion route and strategic objective for the Union army.\nWhile railroads captured much of the cargo transport in the late 1800s, there has been a resurgence of freight traffic in the last half-century. Food, grains, chemicals gravel, and petroleum products are all shipped on the Mississippi.\nThe river originates in many small streams that feed Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota. From there it flows in a generally southern direction, and the middle of the riverbed defines parts of the borders of ten states. Combined with its largest tributary, the Mississippi and Missouri river system is the third longest in the world at over 3,700 miles.\nThe flow of the river is now controlled by 43 dams that contribute to power generation and recreational reservoirs. The flowing river exceeds a mile in width in several locations, and many of the lakes formed by the dams are even wider. The dams south of Minneapolis contain locks to facilitate towboat and barge traffic along the route navigating the Mississippi to New Orleans. In addition, the flow is further moderated by wing dikes that help prevent erosion and preserve the main commercial channel.\nThe ecology and geography are further shaped by levees that line the river. As a result of years of sediment deposit and buildup of the natural levees, in some areas the surface of the river is above the surrounding river plain. Levee breaches often flood portions of the surrounding low-lying areas.\nThe Mississippi River is navigable all the way from Minneapolis to the Gulf of Mexico. There are man-made canals that circumvent major rapids in Illinois and Iowa to facilitate navigating the Mississippi. During the summer months, the drop in water level requires all vessels to navigate marked channels. From the Gulf to Baton Rouge, the 45-foot channel is adequate for many oceangoing ships. North of Baton Rouge, the 9 to 12-foot channel can accommodate most towboats and barges.\nDuring the winter months, the upper Mississippi is prone to ice, and heavy fog often blankets areas of unfrozen water when the air temperature warms. Most of the dams and falls are in the upper portion of the river since more than half of the 1,475 foot vertical drop occurs in Minnesota.\nThe Missouri River joins the Mississippi just north of St. Louis, and the Ohio River joins at Cairo, Illinois. South of Cairo, navigating the Mississippi is a calmer experience, as the river meanders through an extensive, low valley that has been built up by sediment over thousands of years. It enters the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles south of New Orleans through an ever-expanding delta. The river is connected to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and to the Illinois Waterway in the north. The latter provides access to the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway.\nSt. Louis was the gateway for many pioneers that were headed west to start new lives and seek their fortunes. It was no accident that St. Louis and many other cities sprung up along this great waterway. In addition to being a major trade route, it provides a never-ending supply of water for farm irrigation. Other major cities along the Mississippi River include Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Dubuque, Memphis, Vicksburg, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans.\n42explore2.com: the Mississippi River",
    "[ back ]\nFerocious felines at the fair\nIf you visit to the Ohio State Fair, where the Marcan Tiger Show will be presented three times daily through Aug. 12, you might catch the cats involved in a favorite hobby: napping.\nMessenger photos by John Matuszak\nTosheeba, one of the stars of the Marcan Tiger Show at the Ohio State Fair, looks like a big house cat playing with her favorite ball. But she shows off her strength by carrying a bowling ball in her mouth. Dr. Josip Marcan exhibits his animals and talks about the need to preserve this highly endangered species at 1, 3 and 7 p.m. daily.\nBut their owner, Dr. Josip Marcan, is alert to the threat tigers face, and he wants to wake up his audiences to the need to preserve these magnificent animals.\nIn the wild, “they are doomed to extinction, unfortunately,” declared Marcan, who has worked with tigers and other big cats for 50 years.\nThree sub-species are already gone. The Bengals are the most numerous, but there are 1,500 or fewer of those outside of captivity, according to Marcan.\nThe reason for the decline: humans.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, there were three billion people and 100,000 tigers on the planet, he pointed out. At the dawn of the 21st century, there were six billion people and 1,500 tigers.\nTheir habitats in places such as India have been overtaken by a need for more houses and farm land, and many are hunted for hides and the supposed medicinal value of bones and teeth.\nHaving such a small number squeezed into tiny boundaries is not the ideal breeding environment, offered Marcan, who received veterinary training at the Frankfurt Zoo in Germany.\n“That will kill them quicker than poachers,” he said of the resultant in-breeding.\nThis situation led Marcan to establish his own 80-acre tiger preserve in Ponce de Leon, Fla., and to launch his traveling show to educate the public and raise funds for the breeding effort that provides tigers to zoos across the country.\nHis cats make five or six fair appearances a year. This is Marcan’s second visit to the Ohio State Fair, having brought his exhibit to Columbus in 1999.\nIt’s not a circus act, Marcan insisted. Instead, it highlights the bond between tigers and humans and brings out the animals’ natural behavior through positive reinforcement, not punishment.\nEach of the tigers has a different personality, “just like people,” Marcan said. “Some are vicious and some are gentle.”\nThey may loll around like house cats at times, but they also demonstrate their tremendous strength.\nA favorite toy is a bowling ball, which Tosheeba picks up in her mouth and carries around as if it were made of foam rubber.\nThe male Bengal can weigh up to 500 lbs., and the females are around 300 lbs. Bengals are unique in being the only sub-species that has different colored coats, from vivid oranges to almost total white.\nMarcan said he has been lucky to have never been seriously injured by a tiger.\n“I’m very good at reading them. I can tell what kind of mood they’re in, what they’re thinking,” he explained.\nHis affinity for animals began at a young age in his native Croatia, where people brought him dogs and horses to train.\nHe sharpened his skills at the Frankfurt Zoo, eventually becoming assistant director. He became known as an expert on the big cats, earning him appearances on the “Ed Sullivan Show.”\nHe settled in the United States in the late 1960s and established his breeding program.\n“You have to breed responsibly,” he said.\nOne zoo in Washington wanted a Bengal cub, but had to wait for a year and a half until the time was right, Marcan recalled.\nHe believes that preserves such as his are the last hope for the tigers, and that the call of animal rights activists for keeping the animals in the ever-shrinking wild is “unrealistic.”\n“Where is the wild? I want them to show me,” he challenged.\nHis ultimate hope is that the species can be saved until a time when they can be returned to the wild.\nIn the meantime, if people are going to see a live tiger in 50 years, “it will be up to us to keep them alive in captivity,” Marcan said.\nThe Marcan Tiger Show will be presented daily at 1, 3 and 7 p.m. in the arena on the north side of the Celeste Center.\nInformation on Marcan’s program is at www.marcantigers.org.\nInformation about additional fair programs is at www.ohiostatefair.com.\n[ back ]",
    "Brain games STOP depression before it STARTS?\nTotally not necessary.\n[via New Scientist] Brain-training games stop depression before it starts\nIt may be possible to stave off depression before it even appears using brain-scanning software so simplistic in its design that even the psychologist testing it once bet it wouldn’t work.\nIan Gotlib‘s group at Stanford University, California, studies girls aged 10 to 14 years whose mothers suffer from depression. Such girls are thought to be at higher-than-normal risk of developing the condition themselves, in part because they may inherit their mothers’ tendency to “amplify” unpleasant information. Although none of the girls has yet experienced a depressive episode, Gotlib has found that their brains already overreact to negative emotional stimuli – a pattern they share with their mothers and other depressed people.\nGotlib is studying whether these young subjects can use interactive software and brain-imaging hardware to “rewire” their brains by unlearning this negative bias.\nIn a pilot experiment, eight girls used a neural feedback display to learn how to control activity in a network of interrelated brain regions that have been linked to depression – these include the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nThe level of activity in this network was measured using an functional MRI scan and displayed to the girls in the form of a thermometer on a computer screen. The girls were shown sad or negative pictures that might ordinarily raise their “temperature”, and tried to lower that “temperature” by adopting more sanguine mental states. They were then advised to try to recreate that mindset in their daily lives.\nA control group unknowingly watched someone else’s scan output instead of their own, so they didn’t actually learn how to control their brain activity.\nAccentuate the positive\nAnother set of girls in the pilot experiment received their training through a simple computer game instead. In this game, a pair of faces appeared on a screen every few seconds: they would be either neutral and sad, or neutral and happy. Then a dot replaced one of the faces, and the “game” was to click on the dot. For the eight girls in the control group, the face replaced by the dot was selected at random, but for eight girls in the experimental group, the dot always replaced the more positive face in the pair. Over a week of playing this game daily, these girls were in effect being trained to avoid looking at the sad faces.\nGotlib himself originally found this concept, called attentional-bias training, so simplistic that he bet Colin MacLeod, a psychologist at the University of Western Australia in Perth who pioneered the technique, that it would not alter psychological symptoms. Gotlib lost his bet.\nIn his pilot study, both kinds of training significantly reduced stress-related responses – for example, increases in heart rate, blood pressure and cortisol levels – to negative stimuli. These stress responses are a key marker of depression, and they diminished one week after training. The girls in the experimental groups also developed fewer defensive responses to negative faces, such as startled blinking. Control groups showed no such improvement.\nJill Hooley, head of Harvard University’s clinical psychology programme, was impressed by the findings despite the small sample size: “This is highly innovative work,” she said. “Ian is breaking new ground here.”\nGotlib is adding more subjects to the training programme and plans to compare their long-term mental health with a parallel cohort of 200 girls, half of whom have depressed mothers, who aren’t participating in the study.\nNot necessary “Cause, why?” You ask.\nIntroducing: A Glass Full of Awesome!\n[via Gizmodo] You know what’s great? Really good scotch whisky. You know what’s not great? Fake scotch whisky. Worry not. Researchers at St. Andrews University have figured out how to test your whisky’s authenticity by shooting it with lasers. Mmm, whisky-lasers…\nHere’s how it works. Researchers put a drop of whisky on a chip the that’s about the size of a credit card. They then use a couple of fiber optics (no thicker than human hairs), one of which lights it up, while the other analyzes it. The technique looks at the fluorescence of whisky and the scattering of light when it interacts with various molecules, which is called its Raman signature.\nThey claim to be able to determine the whisky’s brand, age, and cask. Pretty incredible if it’s true. I wonder how they plan on compiling this database, though. Do they expect distilleries to give them a bottle from every batch? If so, how do I join these guys?\nThere’s good news and bad news here. The good news is that they only need a single drop of whisky in order to determine its authenticity. Waste more than a single droplet of that golden elixer and you’d have me rioting. The bad news, well, you have get a drop out, which means you need to open the bottle. That in itself means it’s not going to be much use to us consumers, directly. It’s more for distributers or stores who are buying in bulk and want to make sure they’re getting a crate of the real McCoy. Those types won’t mind sacrificing a bottle for the greater good. On the flip side of the coin, you would have to pry that bottle of Lagavulin out of my cold, dead, drunk hands. Indirectly, though, it benefits consumers who buy from distributors and stores, hopefully ensuring we get what we pay for.\nIs there ANY type of depression that could stand up against this glass-bound bit of wonderful?\n*shakes head, smiling*\nI think not.\nAnd although it is understandable that the girls in the first article are far too young to benefit (not to mention) Whisky+Laser?\nI, however, am not…\nThank. You. Gawd!\n“Bartender, I’ll take a whisky, please. I have my laser at the ready–Bring it on!” Pew, pew-pew pew. “Perfection!”\nWhy yes *sips*, indeed it is.",
    "Hundreds of years ago, settlers who came to Fort Worth were greeted by rolling prairies for as far as the eye could see.

    "Photo: John Evans (flickr)\nCancer can be a long and painful disease. Many times, the drugs that are used to fight cancer can be just as excruciating as the disease itself.\nAntibiotics, as the name implies, work against life, or more specifically, against living cells. Most antibiotics, such as penicillin or erythromycin, attack bacterial cells in specific ways that don’t affect animal cells. That way the bacteria causing the infection are destroyed without harming the patient.\nBut cancer is different from other diseases in that the cells in a cancer tumor are human cells. The main difference between cancer cells and healthy cells is that the cancer cells are multiplying uncontrollably. Therefore, the antibiotics that attack cancer cells might also attack healthy cells.\nOne way chemotherapy drugs work is by interrupting the production of DNA. All cells have DNA, which must be reproduced when new cells are made. Since DNA is involved in reproduction, the cells that are reproducing the fastest, such as cancer cells, are also the ones that are producing the most DNA. For this reason, the rapidly growing cancer cells are most affected by drugs that interrupt the production of DNA.\nThe cells in the hair follicles and in the stomach lining also reproduce faster than most other cells. Consequently, when chemotherapy interrupts DNA production in cancer cells, it also interrupts DNA production in hair follicles and in the stomach lining, causing chemotherapy patients to lose hair and experience severe stomach problems.\nThe side effects of chemotherapy are worse than the side effects of most other drugs because chemotherapy attacks human cells, while other antibiotics attack specifically bacteria cells.",
    "If you think that exercise doesn't affect your body because you're stuck with sub-optimal (in your opinion) DNA, time to think again. As reported by Science Daily, new research suggests that exercise can change DNA within muscle cells rather quickly — within minutes.\nThe study, published online Tuesday in Cell Metabolism, found that genetic molecules in muscle cells of 20 healthy men and women changed in ways after exercise that might help \"turn on\" genes that help make stronger muscles. The changes help muscles adapt to exercise.\nExercise caused what's known as epigenetic modifications. Methyl groups in DNA were lost as a result of exercise and this helped increase gene expression, or turned them on.\nResearchers saw these changes after only 20 minutes of exercise on an exercise bike.\nOne of the researchers, Juleen Zierath of Karolinska Institute in Sweden, said \"muscle adapts to what you do. If you don't use it, you lose it, and this is one of the mechanisms that allows that to happen.\"\nResearchers also found that caffeine caused similar changes in the genes of muscle cells. But don't go out and drink coffee instead of exercising. Zierath told Nature that to see the effects on muscles, \"one would need to consume a caffeine equivalent of about 50 cups per day, almost close to a lethal dose. Exercise is far easier if you ask me.\"\nIf you're ready to start experiencing exercise's many benefits, be sure to check out ACE's Fit Facts about getting started.",
    "Fast growing small businesses create most new jobs.(Storey. Warwick Business School)\nThey are usually under-financed and have cashflow problems, which limit their growth phase. They are usually profitable and pay large amounts of corporation tax.\nIf this sector could be targeted for 100% corporation tax relief, it would save the government money, as far more jobs would be created, and the capital base of such companies would establish quicker and more would survive any sudden downturns.\nThe growth phase of most fast growing companies (20% per annum or more) is usually about ten years. If growth is defined as growth in sales combined with growth in employment, once a company hits plus 20% they should pay no corporation tax. At plus 10% they should pay half. At plus 5% three quarters. Another condition, no dividends should be payable.\nThese incentives would persuade far more small companies to plan for growth, increase the country's productivity, and its capital base.\nMost entrepreneurs tire after ten years of 20% plus growth. At least these golden years would not be wasted in payment of tax.",
    "Preparing Your Child for Sleep-Away Camp\nWhen summer rolls around, many parents prepare to send their children to sleep-away camp. Before making a decision on a camp, though, you should consider what kind of camping experience will benefit both your child and family.\nAsk plenty of questions: How does my child feel about going away? Has he or she handled previous sleep-away experiences well? What do other people who know my child outside the home—teachers, mentors, or coaches—think about the idea? Understand that a child's age is less important than his or her emotional and temperamental makeup (although most camps have a minimum age of 10).\nMake sure your child will enjoy the camp's activities. Camp activities vary greatly, and often focus on particular areas, such as competitive sports, nature studies, or the arts.\nGather as much information as possible. For example, review camp videotapes, meet with camp directors and counselors, ask friends and neighbors how their children enjoyed camps you are considering, and, if possible, visit the campsite itself. Once you've chosen a camp, write letters to the counselors describing your child's temperament and the activities he or she likes.\nMonitor your own separation-anxiety level. Try not to make your anxiety too evident, because children tend to feed off their parents' fears. You can take some comfort in that you have fully researched and chosen what you consider to be the best camp. Once your child is away, talk to the camp director or a counselor to see how your child is faring.\nMany camps offer special services to children with just about any type of physical, medical, emotional, or psychological disability or need. One question to ask is whether a camp that exclusively provides special services to children with special needs is preferable to a camp that has a more inclusive, mainstream setting.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics stresses that camps should match the interests and the emotional and developmental levels of the child. With good background research, you will be able to make a successful camp selection for your child.",
    "|The ternary calculating machine of Thomas Fowler|\nFowler's Binary and Ternary Tables\nOne of Thomas Fowler’s many professions was as Treasurer of the Poor Law Union. This was an organization that collected fees (establishment charges) from each parish in the Union to aid the poor in the community. The amount of the fee was proportional to the value (assessment) of the parish. Thus, Fowler had to calculate the value of each parish relative to the Union as a whole, and then knowing the overall fees to be collected by the entire Union, calculate the fraction that each parish owes.\nThis task was made much more complicated by the pre-decimal English currency (abbreviated as £sd after the symbols for pounds, shillings and pence). There were twenty shillings to a pound, twelve pence to a shilling and four farthings to a penny. When calculating proportions as Fowler needed to do, each monetary value would be converted into farthings before doing any calculations. With 960 farthings to the pound, these numbers became very large. The process was tedious, but decimal British currency was still over 130 years away.\nWhen faced with this huge task, Fowler developed a system which used lower bases to ease his calculating burden. In 1838, he published his Tables for Facilitating Arithmetical Calculations with the subtitle Intended for Calculating the Proportionate Charges on the Parishes in Poor Law Unions. This book contains a table of binary numbers for values from decimal 1 to 130048, and a table of balanced ternary numbers from decimal 1 to 3985807. Fowler also describes in detail how he uses these tables to simplify the particular type of calculations required for Poor Law Unions. Details of Fowler’s method are given here.\nA sample page of the ternary tables is shown at the left. For each decimal number in the leftmost column, the next two columns identify the powers of three, both positive and negative, to express that number in balanced ternary. The column at the far right is used to expand the range of the table by a factor of 3^6. Each number in the center of the block of three can be expressed in balanced ternary by adding six to the value of the indicies shown to the left. The number directly above and below indicate the range over which this value can be used. For example, numbers between 1094 and 3280 can be determined by converting the middle number, 2187, into balanced ternary, and then looking up the remainder in the leftmost columns of the table, keeping in mind that the remainder may actually be a negative value.\npublication of his book preceded his calculating machine by two years.\nThe machine is clearly designed as a mechanical aid to\nthis particular technique of calculation. Fowler’s technique has\ndefinite advantages for the repetitive calculations required at the Poor\nLaw Union, but for less repetitive problems, the conversion to and from\nbalanced ternary might be more difficult than calculating the problem\ndirectly in decimal.",

Entire villages are said to have disappeared in this region, usually spared by typhoons. According to the last information, the death toll would rise to 1.010 and numerous missing people.\nThe poorest layers of the population, living in flimsy housing at the water's edge, were particularly touched by the catastrophe. Millions of people are, as a consequence, homeless and lack food or clothes. At the same time, more than 280.000 people would be displaced, 40.000 could be sheltered in temporary housing centers.\nPresident, Benigno Aquino, promised to the victims a special help from the State, devoted to the building of new houses. One condition to receive this finantial assistance: avoid the areas liable to flooding. The government and the Red Cross asked the international society to answer to the urge needs.

    "Brain Cancer Diagnosis & Detection\nLearn More About Diagnosing Brain Cancer: Chat with Us | Email Us\nVideo: How Are Neurological Cancers Diagnosed?Learn how neurological cancers, such as brain or spinal cancer, are diagnosed. Dr. Baird talks about the advanced diagnostic imaging tools used and procedures performed to diagnose the disease.\nBrain Cancer Diagnosis\nCTCA neurosurgeon Dr. Clinton Baird explains how neurologic cancers are diagnosed, beginning with a review of health history and symptoms, followed by imaging tools and biopsy/surgical resection.\nAn effective brain cancer treatment plan begins with an accurate diagnosis. At Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA), our team of cancer experts uses advanced imaging technologies and tools to precisely evaluate malignant and benign brain tumors.\nOnce we make an accurate brain cancer diagnosis—and are able to determine the location, type and grade of the tumor—we’ll work with you to formulate a treatment plan that best suits your needs. Because of the complexities of brain tumors, treatment should be based on a tailored, individualized approach.\nBenign vs. Malignant Primary Brain Tumors\nNot all primary brain tumors are the same. Primary brain tumors can be divided into malignant or benign tumors.\n- Benign primary brain tumors are not cancerous. They grow slowly, and tend to be more amendable to surgical or other treatments. However, benign brain tumors can still damage normal brain tissue and cause serious problems.\n- Malignant brain tumors are more aggressive by definition. They grow more quickly and invade local structures more aggressively.\nBrain Cancer Diagnostic Tools & Tests\nWe may use any of the following tests and tools to make an accurate brain cancer diagnosis. Once complete, we will use this information to develop your personalized treatment plan.\n- Health History & Physical Examination: This includes a physical exam for general signs of health and a review of your medical history and symptoms.\n- Neurological Examination: This includes a series of questions and tests for vision, hearing, motor skills, memory, cognition, and other neurologic functions.\n- Imaging Tests: These tests use imaging technologies to produce pictures of the brain to determine the location and grade of brain tumors. A contrast agent may be used to distinguish normal and abnormal brain tissue.\n- CT scan\n- PET scan (primarily for spinal cancer)\n- Nuclear Medicine Bone Scan - This scan can reveal if cancer has spread to the bone. In a bone scan, a small dose of radioactive material is injected into a blood vessel, where it travels through the bloodstream. The material then gathers in the bones and is detected by a scanner through nuclear imaging.\n- Angiography – During this scan, X-rays obtain multiple, detailed 3D images of the blood vessels in the brain. This test may be used to plan the surgical resection of a tumor that is near an area of the brain with many blood vessels. Sometimes, this test is used to embolize (close off) blood vessels feeding a tumor prior to surgery.\n- Biopsy/Surgical Resection: Whenever possible, a full surgical resection of the cancerous tissue is performed. If such a resection threatens neurological function, then a lesser resection, or simple biopsy, is performed. A biopsy involves the removal of a small amount of the cancerous tissue from the brain. A pathologist will then examine the tissue under a microscope for a definitive diagnosis. This helps us evaluate the tumor to plan your treatment. A needle biopsy may be performed for tumors in difficult-to-reach or critical areas of the brain.\nFor individuals with metastatic brain cancer, your doctor may perform additional tests to determine where the cancer originated.\nThroughout your brain cancer treatment, we’ll use advanced imaging tests to track the disease and monitor your response to treatment. Once your brain cancer treatment is complete, we’ll follow you closely with imaging tests to stay on top of any recurrence and determine if further treatment is needed.\nNext Topic: Brain Cancer Grading",
    "A new technique enables the conversion of an ordinary camera into a light-field camera capable of recording high-resolution, multiperspective images.\nBuddhist monks will begin construction of the Chenrezig Mandala--an intricate three-dimensional image made of colored sand that's intended to bring compassion, acceptance and peace into the world--at Simmons Hall on March 3. They will work daily until its completion, probably on March 7.\nThe mandala will be constructed on a wooden platform a few feet above the ground, grain of sand by grain of sand according to instructions found in a thousand-year-old text. The completed mandala will be four feet in diameter. Tenzin Yignyen, a monk from the Namgyal Monastery in Ithaca, N.Y., who has constructed several mandalas with His Holiness The Dalai Lama, will lead the project. He will be assisted by Tenzin L.S. Priyadarshi, the Buddhist chaplain at MIT, who organized the event with help from a team of Simmons Hall residents, including faculty and staff.\n\"Mandala is a Sanskrit word meaning 'cosmograph,'a three-dimensional map of the universe. Its construction symbolizes construction of the universe as we would want it to be in a three-dimensional circular pattern where many things come together and everything finds its proper place,\" Priyadarshi said.\n\"There are different kinds of mandalas with different patterns. This one is the mandala of the Buddha of compassion; it is supposed to construct a world of compassion, acceptance and peace. With it, we are asking the question: What do we do with our diversity and how may we actualize the compassionate side of being human?\" he said.\nAfter completing the mandala, which represents the universe as well as the impermanence of this world, the monks will carry it to one of the bridges spanning the Charles River and pour the sand into the river so its message of peace and compassion can be carried along by the flowing water.\nThe monks invite the MIT community to view the mandala-making and to pray, chant and meditate with them. They will hold an opening ceremony on Thursday, March 4 at 7 p.m. for MIT community members only, who may view the construction at any time. Public viewing hours are Friday, March 5 from 2-6 p.m.; Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon and 2-7 p.m.; and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.\nThe Buddhist community at MIT has planned other events in conjunction with the mandala, including a panel session with Professor Emeritus Mel King at the Sidney-Pacific Residence Hall on Friday, March 5 at 7 p.m.; a children's mandala-making session (MIT only) on Saturday from 2-5 p.m.; and a screening of \"The Lost Treasures of Tibet\" on Sunday at 6 p.m. The monks will dismantle the mandala at 10 a.m. Monday.\nAll events will be held in Simmons Hall unless otherwise noted.

    "|Anarchism in culture|\n|Anarchism by region|\nAnarchism is a political theory which aims to create anarchy, \"the absence of a master, of a sovereign.\" (Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, What is Property, p. 264) In other words, anarchism is a political theory which aims to create a society within which individuals freely co-operate together as equals. As such anarchism isn't social chaos and a return to the \"laws of the jungle.\"\nThis process of misrepresentation is not without historical parallel. For example, in countries which have considered government by one person (monarchy) necessary, the words \"republic\" or \"democracy\" have been used precisely like \"anarchy\", to imply disorder and confusion. Those with a vested interest in preserving the status quo will obviously wish to imply that opposition to the current system cannot work in practice, and that a new form of society will only lead to chaos. Or, as Errico Malatesta expresses it:\n\"since it was thought that government was necessary and that without government there could only be disorder and confusion, it was natural and logical that anarchy, which means absence of government, should sound like absence of order.\" [Anarchy, p. 12].\n\"Change opinion, convince the public that government is not only unnecessary, but extremely harmful, and then the word anarchy, just because it means absence of government, will come to mean for everybody: natural order, unity of human needs and the interests of all, complete freedom within complete solidarity.\" [Ibid., pp. 12-13].\n|anarchism is a popular tag and you can find media on this topic on||Tag|\n The meaning of anarchism\n| Echo of Freedom, Radical Podcast has a podcast related to this aticle|\nHello, World!

Graham (Ed), p. 75]\nAnarchism, therefore, is a political theory that aims to create a society which is without political, economic or social hierarchies. Anarchists maintain that anarchy, the absence of rulers, is a viable form of social system and so work for the maximisation of individual liberty and social equality. They see the goals of liberty and equality as mutually self-supporting.

    "What is a Veterinarian?\nA veterinarian is a physician who has been educated and trained to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries in animals. Most veterinarians care for companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats, birds, ferrets, rabbits). They may specialize in care for horses (both pleasure and performance), production animals (e.g., dairy and beef cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry), aquatic, and zoo animals. Veterinarians vaccinate, attend births, administer medication, perform surgeries, and provide general health care.\nVeterinarians may perform biomedical research (i.e., genomics, cellular mechanisms, cancer biology) and/or serve as faculty at colleges or universities. They also play a role in public health, preventing the spread of animal diseases to humans, ensuring the safety of the food supply, and performing livestock health inspections.Board Certification\nThe board certification process includes the following components:Education\n- Experience working with animals prior to applying to a veterinary program is desirable.\n- Completion of undergraduate prerequisite courses. Requirements vary, but on average, 2-3 years of undergraduate study is required for admission. Most veterinary students have a baccalaureate degree and some earn advanced degrees prior to enrolling in a veterinary program.\n- Completion of a 4-year program leading to a doctor of veterinary medicine (DVM or VMD) degree.\nThere are 27 accredited veterinary colleges or universities in the United States. The veterinary curriculum focuses on biomedical science, including anatomy, physiology, bacteriology, virology, medicine, and surgery. Programs also include coursework in topics such as professional development, practice management, and client relations.\nMost programs are divided into a preclinical and a clinical phase. The first phase is primarily concerned with classroom study and laboratory work. The second, clinical, phase allows students to learn medical and surgical principles through hands-on experience. Students are trained to treat many animal species and later may focus on certain groups, such as companion animals, production animals, and horses.Certification\nFollowing graduation, veterinarians must pass the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE). State licensing boards set eligibility requirements; candidates must apply for NAVLE certification through their state boards. Graduates may continue clinical training through an internship or residency and must obtain state board approval before opening a clinical practice.\nAn extended period of formal study is required for board certification in a specialty, such as surgery, ophthalmology, pathology, radiology, and medicine. Medical subspecialties include cardiology, oncology, and neurology.Additional Accreditation\nIn addition to accreditation by the NAVLE, veterinarians interested in working with federal and state animal health officials may also seek accreditation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS). The National Veterinary Accreditation Program (NVAP) is administered by APHIS. Although the program is voluntary, more than 80% of veterinarians in the United States are accredited by NVAP.",
    "- Special Sections\n- Dawgs Deals\nGiven the high concentration of poison found at the site of the historic trees at Auburn University, experts say the trees are not likely to survive.\nSoil samples were taken to Mississippi State University for testing.\nAuburn University said in a statement Wednesday that a herbicide commonly used to kill trees was applied â€śin lethal amountsâ€ť to the soil around the two trees. Auburn discovered the poisoning after taking soil samples on Jan. 28, a day after a man called a syndicated radio show based in Birmingham saying he had used herbicide on the trees.\nDr. David Shaw, vice president of research and economic development at MSU said the herbicide used on the trees was Tebuthiuron, or Spike 80DF, labeled for use to control oaks and many other shrub and tree species.\nShaw said it is safe for humans but very potent on species such as oaks, and was fairly easy to detect.\nHe said the herbicide is readily available for certified pesticide applicators.\nShaw said the trees will begin showing symptomology after the leaves begin emerging.\nGiven the high concentrations of herbicide found Shaw is not optimistic that the trees will survive.\nâ€śOver a period of a few weeks this will worsen and ultimately they will die,â€ť Shaw said.\nIn addition, Shaw said Auburn University will have to either plant species that are tolerant to the herbicide or excavate the soil and replace it with uncontaminated soil.",
    "On the Eve : The Jews of Europe Before the Second World War Paperback\nThis is the portrait of a world on the eve of its destruction.\nBernard Wasserstein presents a disturbing interpretation of the collapse of European Jewish civilization even before the Nazi onslaught and World War Two. In this revisionist account of modern European Jewry, Wasserstein shows how the harsh realities of the age devastated the lives of communities and individuals.\nBy 1939, the Jews faced an existential crisis that was as much the result of internal decay as of external attack. Ranging from Vilna ('Jerusalem of Lithuania') to Salonica with its Judeo-Espanol-speaking stevedores and singers, and beyond, the book's focus is squarely on the Jews themselves rather than their persecutors. Wasserstein's aim is to 'breathe life into dry bones.' Based on vast research, written with compassion and empathy, and enlivened by dry wit, On the Eve paints a vivid and shocking picture of the European Jews in their final hour.\n- Format: Paperback\n- Pages: 576 pages\n- Publisher: Profile Books Ltd\n- Publication Date: 23/05/2013\n- Category: European history\n- ISBN: 9781846681905\n- EPUB from £8.79",

    "Add a comment\nAlong with Awareness and Will, Trust makes up the trio of central principles of the Inner Game. In some ways, Trust is the most fundamental of the three: the heart of the inner game is about getting your judgemental, conscious self out the way and letting your carefully-honed skills get on with the job.\nMany of the basic exercises in the original inner game context of tennis are essentially about trust, and usually involve providing a focus for the conscious brain to keep it occupied and out of mischief so that it doesn’t start interfering with what you’re doing. Saying ‘bounce’ when the ball hits the ground and ‘hit’ when it meets the racket may be an absurdly simply thing to do, but it very effectively silences the distracting stream of inner commentary and keeps your attention on the tennis ball.\nTrust exercises for ensembles often have elements of play involved – they invite people to relinquish their dignity and instead engage their fantasy. Examples might include:\n- Replacing the given text with a funny word. (Pick your word according to the musical and expressive context, but useful possibilities include: penguin, avocado, toenail and antidisestablishmentarianism.) Encourage the singers to imbue the word with the full meaning of the actual text in all its dramatic glory.\n- Sitting-standing-kneeling (as seen in the improvisational game show Whose Line Is It Anyway?). As you sing, each choir member has to make sure that they are in a different position from the singers either side of them.\n- Adopt a character quite at odds with actual persona of the music. A Dies Irae sung in the style of an eager four-year-old, for example, or a tender love-song in the style of a vengeful harpy.\nThese kinds of exercises are useful in a general way for lightening the atmosphere, getting tension of the voices, bodies and minds, and building a sense of team – all of which are by-products of the basic banishment of negative self-talk. But you can also deploy trust games more strategically to promote specific learning goals. Singing ‘bingo’ every time your part has an accidental supports the development of music literacy; or, at a more advanced stage, singing ‘bingo’ every time the music features a secondary dominant.\nIn a choral situation of course, you have the double layer of trust issues: the basic inner game issue of trusting yourself, and the ensemble issue of trusting each other. My hunch is that these two layers are interdependent. It is hard to immerse yourself into the musical flow if you know that another singer is liable to criticise your part for its tuning periodically throughout the rehearsal; likewise, it is hard believe in your colleagues if you don’t believe in yourself.\nAnd this has particular relevance for directors. If we want to help our singers trust themselves, we also need to trust them. Yes of course they are going to make mistakes – they are after all human beings, and that’s why we have rehearsals after all. But we don’t have to spend our rehearsals waiting to pounce on them, and we certainly don’t have to interrupt the singers every two bars over every mis-matched vowel. If we offer our singers the opportunity to make music, to create beauty, to be expressive, they will reward us with much better quality attention when we turn to the detailed work – and they’ll also make fewer mistakes to begin with.",
    "The Human Brain Project: following CERN’s example\nby Prof. Henry Markram (Blue Brain Project, Founder & Director - Brain Mind Institute, EPFL)\nat CERN ( 40-S2-D01 - Salle Dirac )\nThe Human Brain Project aims to lay the technical foundations for a new model of ICT-based brain research, driving integration between data and knowledge from different disciplines, and catalyzing a community effort to achieve a new understanding of the brain, new treatments for brain disease and new brain-like computing technologies. This will enable collaborative research in brain research and its applications similar to the way that CERN has pioneered this type of large-scale collaborative science for high engery physics. The HBP aims to build 6 ICT platforms: Neuroinformatics Platform, Medical Informatics Platform, Brain Simulation Platform, High Performance Computing Platform, Neuromorphic Computing Platform and Neurorobotics Platform as part of the mission. The primary reason that we do not understand the brain is because what we know is highly fragmented. The overarching strategy of the HBP is therefore to bind researchers from different disciplines together in a grand attempt at putting the fragmented pieces of data and knowledge together into a unifying computer model of the Human brain. Major trends in ICT indicate the time is ripe to begin this international effort. The potential benefits are huge: in brain research we could begin to understand how the brain codes physical reality and gives rise to cognition and behavior by exploiting 9 orders of magnitude on the spatial scale and 18 orders of magnitude on the temporal scale; in clinical brain research, we will be able to begin mapping out the vulnerabilities of the different brain diseases and develop personalized medicine; in future computing we will be able to extract tested architectures and validated principles to build brain-inspired interactive supercomputers and tailored neuromorphic computing systems that could increase efficiency of certain types of computing by several orders of magnitude.\nCoordinator of the Human Brain Project, EPFL",
    "This paper reflects the research and thoughts of a student at the time the paper was written for a course at Bryn Mawr College. Like other materials on Serendip, it is not intended to be \"authoritative\" but rather to help others further develop their own explorations. Web links were active as of the time the paper was posted but are not updated.\n2000 First Web Report\nFor the majority of this class I have been a fence-sitter with'mystical' leanings. However when I decided to do my paper on smoking, I found in the phenomina of addiction a very strong argument for our brain=behavior hypothesis. In the following essay, I will describe the biological effects of nicotine on the Central Nervous System and some of the resulting behavioral effects. Afterwards I will present thoughts as to why I believe addiction is a very important point to be considered in the question we've been asking since the first day of class.\nWhen an individual smokes a cigarette, the nicotine travels to the brain where it binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing them to fire action potentials (2). This in turn causes the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (2). Professor Gaylord Ellison in the department of psychology at UCLA, while testing the effects of drugs on rats found that nicotine is destructive to the part of the brain (called the fasciculus retroflexus) that determines the levels of dopamine and seretonin in an organism. \"Dopamine controls movement, emotional response, and the ability to experience pleasure and pain, while seretonin regulates a person'a mood\" (4). When nicotine binds with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the resulting release of dopamine increases its concentration from what would normally be found in the brain, thus producing a pleasurable effect on the smoker. When nicotine binds with these acetylcholine receptors it slows down their natural rate of deterioration (being proteins, they are constantly breaking down as new ones are being made), but the rate at which new ones are produced remains unchanged. This leads to an overall increase in the number of receptors.(3).\nOver time and with constant exposure, the nicotine will begin to act as an antagonist, desensitizing the receptors it once activated. Thus a smoker will have to smoke more and more to try and achieve the same pleasurable effects.(3).\nThe half-life of nicotine in humans is two hours. Thus, a person who smokes regularly will be constantly exposed to the substance untill he goes to sleep at night and his neurons have a chance to recover, or if he for some other reason abstains from smoking for long periods of time. Tests were conducted at Baylor College Of Medicine that compaired (among other things) the effects on relevant neurons of a pressure injection of nicotine comparable to the amount received when a cigarette is smoked, with the effects seen on those neurons when the nicotine was applied constantly over time. In the first instance, the application of nicotine, \"...caused a depolarization of the resting membrane potential. After 1 min in 0.5 M nicotine, the neuron fired continuous action potentials that were no longer influenced by the pressure injections of ACh, as would be expected if most of the nAChRs were desensitized\" (2). However, when the nicotine was introduced for a period of nineteen minutes, after the first five minutes, \"...the currents activated by pressure injection of ACh were more strongly desensitized, and the baseline current decreased nearly to its original pre-nicotine position\" (2). This shows that the long exposure to nicotine that most smokers experience can severely desensitize nicotonic acetylcholine receptors.\nPeople who are addicted to cigarettes show behavioral patterns that are often contrary to those they would chose to exhibit. A big part of the discussion on whether brain=behavior has been the issue of free will. We all must eat, drink, sleep, and breathe; these are behaviors dictated by the brain as a result of the body's needs. If we want to survive, we have relatively little choice in these matters. However, no one needs to smoke to survive. If we define free will as the ability, when given more than one option or course, do choose and enact the option you want, then the choice to smoke or not to smoke should be a matter of free will. For a smoker however, this is not the case. I live in a smoking dormitory, and have heard numerous times the exclamations of friends swearing that they are going to quit smoking - I usualy see them lighting up before the end of the day.\nTypically, the first cigarette smoked after waking is the most enjoyable because, as was stated earlier, neurons have had a chance to recover somewhat from their usual onsaught of nicotine. It is estimated that at least eight hours of sleep are required to allow for this recovery (1).'\"A person trying to quit has to get out of bed without that cigarette, and we have been getting a lot of anecdotal material telling us that people just can't\" Dain said'. Their altered nuerons that have resulted from regular smoking have become used to functioning with constant nicotine bound to their receptors. Without the nicotine they cannot function smoothly. Of the 30% of smokers who try to quit each year, only about 3% succeed (3). But even a smoker does not need nicotine to survive. I found no evidence of people having died from nicotine withdrawl. So if neuron functions can win out over free will - if matter can win out over \"mind\" - then this leads me to believe that the brain really does dictate behavior. Though 30% of smokers may desire to quit, the functioning of their neurons will not allow them to.\n2), Dani, John A., DeBiasi, Mariella, Pidoplichko, Volodymyr I., Williams, John T.

    "Dying Suddenly - Sudden Cardiac Death\nPeople at Risk\n- Individuals who have coronary artery disease, especially those who have suffered myocardial infarctions (\"heart attacks\") in the past\n- Individuals who have congestive heart failure of any cause\n- Individuals with intrinsic heart muscle disease such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia\n- Individuals with family history of heart muscle disease and SCD\n- Individuals with syncope of unknown cause\n- Individuals who abuse cocaine or heroin\nCoronary artery disease is the underlying heart disease in 70 to 90% of individuals who succumb to SCD. Although many episodes of SCD are called \"heart attacks,\" most of them, in fact, do not represent new myocardial infarctions. The arrhythmias that occur originate in previously damaged regions of the heart, and no new heart damage is necessary to start the arrhythmias.\nPatients with congestive heart failure are at high risk of SCD. As left ventricular ejection fraction falls, the risk of SCD increases regardless of the underlying cause of the heart disease. Ironically, CHF patients who receive certain types of antiarrhythmic drugs are particularly prone to suffer proarrhythmic side effects of the medications because of interactions between the medications and the diseased tissue. Some non-antiarrhythmic medications, the beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, have been shown to decrease the risk of SCD in CHF patients, but the degree of risk is still much higher than that of a normal healthy person.\nSCD is frequently seen in individuals with heart diseases where the primary problem lies with the heart muscle cells themselves; these diseases are called cardiomyopathies. Different cardiomyopathies are caused by different cellular defects, but most of the cardiomyopathies are associated at one time or another with congestive heart failure and the formation of scar tissue in the ventricles. Since many cardiomyopathies are genetically transmitted, individuals in families that exhibit cardiomyopathy who have family members that have died suddenly appear to be more prone to SCD than those without a family history of SCD.\nSyncope is spontaneous loss of consciousness. Since arrhythmias may cause syncope and may also be the first and only manifestation of heart disease, thorough cardiac evaluation following an episode of syncope is very important. Although the most common causes of syncope are relatively benign, \"aborted\" SCD should be considered as a possible cause of syncope, especially in a patient who has not been evaluated. If no heart disease is found after thorough evaluation and the history suggests a simple drop in blood pressure in the absence of arrhythmias, one can be reassured that the likelihood of life-threatening disease is low.\nMany drugs have been associated with serious arrhythmias. Antiarrhythmic medications, when administered to patients with heart disease, can have proarrhythmic effects as noted above. Cocaine has been noted to cause spasm of the coronary arteries and, in large repeated doses, to have a direct toxic effect on the heart muscle. The cocaine-induced cardiomyopathy shows the same tendency toward arrhythmias as other cardiomyopathies. In addition, cocaine increases adrenaline and catecholamine levels in the bloodstream that further stresses the heart and exacerbates the tendency toward arrhythmias.",
    "Chaturmas (Sanskrit: चातुर्मास, Cāturmāsa) is a period of four months beginning on Shayani Ekadashi - the 11th day of the first bright half of Ashadh (fourth month of the Hindu lunar calendar) until Prabodhini Ekadashi - the 11th day of the first bright half of the Kartik (eighth month of the Hindu lunar calender). It is believed that Hindu gods and goddesses are at rest.\nThe sun enters the orbit of Karka (Cancer) and begins to move southwards in the month of Ashadh. The Hindu preserver-god Vishnu is believed to sleep on this day, hence the 11th of Ashadh is called as Devashayani Ekadashi. He is believed to wake up on 11th of Kartik, hence called as Prabodhini Ekadashi. It corresponds with the rainy season in India.\nSignificance in HinduismEdit\nThis period of four months is prescribed for penance, austerities, religious observances, recital of mantras, bathing in holy rivers, performing sacrifices, worship and charity. Fasts and purity during this period helps maintaining health. This period considered inauspicious for marriages and other such ceremonies.\nSignificance for SanyasisEdit\nThe Sanyasis or the ascetics observe Chaturmas for four fortnights, beginning on full moon day of the month Ashadh also known as Guru Purnima or Vyas Purnima, and ending on full moon day of the month Bhadrapada. Sanyasis are supposed to halt during this period at one selected place, giving discourse to the public.\nMajor fetivals within this holy period include:\n- Krishna Janmashtami\n- Raksha Bandhan\n- Ganesh Chaturthi\n- Navratri (Dasara - Durga Puja - Vijayadashami)\n- ↑ Bhalla, Prem P.

    "Al sh'loshah d'varim haolam omed: Al haTorah, v'al ha-avodah, v'al g'milut chasadim. The world depends on three things: on Torah, on worship and on loving deeds. - Pirkei Avot 1:2\nThis year each issue of Vshinantam will focus on adolescents and applications for our Jewish educational and youth settings. In this third issue, we look at teens and technology and begin to answer the questions of how does teen use of technology impact their learning and our teaching and how can we embrace the technology available to enhance teaching and learning.\nTodays teens are digital natives; They study, work, write, and interact with each other in ways that are very different from the ways you did growing up Theyre connected to one another by a common culture. Major aspects of their lives-social interactions, friendships, civic activitiesare mediated by digital technologies. And they have never known another way of life. (Palfrey and Gasser, 2) On the other hand, many teachers are digital immigrants, having adopted the Internet and related technologies, but who were born prior to the digital age and often playing catch-up to their digital native students. This issue of Vshinantam will focus on the affects that the digital age have on adolescent development and the challenges and opportunities it holds for Jewish education.\nThe widespread use of technology has an impact in almost every aspect of a teenagers life. It affects their brain, social/emotional, identity and moral development as well as how they learn. According to Dr. David Walsh, author of Why Do They Act that Way?: A Survival Guide to the Adolescent Brain for You and Your Teen, technology is changing the way we live and communicate as electronic media becomes integrated into the daily lives of teens. Adolescents spend more time engaging with these media than in any other activity, including school. All this media access and use affects our teens. As teachers and trusted adults in the lives of teenagers, we need to be aware of the effects and the ways we can help teenagers Jewishly navigate their digital world.\nJewish education, like all education, needs to adjust to the rapid flow of technological advances that will replace our traditional methodology in the classroom. With the aid of the world at their fingertips, adolescents will no longer tolerate a learning environment out of the last century. (Philip, 4) In this section, we take a look at a few areas of adolescent development and how we might use technology in our learning environments.\nBrain Development The teen brain is under construction. The frontal lobes, the area responsible for abstract thinking, reason, language, and decision-making is developing significantly during adolescence. Therefore, unlike the adult brain, the teen brain relies heavily on the amygdala, the center of emotion. This explains why teens make poor decisions and highly have emotional responses to ordinary situations, questions, or requests. Experience also plays a significant role in brain development, shaping what parts of the brain will be pruned and what will become hardwired. Evaluating content is also difficult for teenagers because the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in selection, interpretation and evaluation, is not fully developed. Due to their shorter attention spans they often do not evaluate information thoroughly and have fewer experiences against which to compare the information. Neurology and technology together impact the teen brain in ways we are just discovering.\nTechnology tool: Journaling is a good habit for teens because it requires them to reflect on their experiences. Weblogs, or blogs, are easily created and updateable websites that allow the author to publish instantly to the Internet. Blogging engages in the processes of thinking, writing, and reflection. Ask students to create blogs about the lessons in the weekly Torah portion, ethical dilemmas in the news, or volunteer experiences. Teachers, parents and other students can post comments and engage students in the process of reflecting on their experiences.\nSocial Development As with any new technology (telephone, tv, etc.) its introduction influences society and the way people interact with each other. The advent of so many new technologies developing so rapidly and available relatively inexpensively is having a profound impact on teenagers. Teens have adopted this technology very aggressively everything a teenager does is about being mobile and untethered its a newer way of connecting socially. (Philip, 75) Social connections for teens occur through the Internet, instant messaging, texting, and via cell phone. They can be anywhere at anytime and be connected to each other.\nTechnology tool: Because learning is no longer primarily fixed in time and space; it can happen anytime and anywhere that we are connected it forces us to rethink our physical teaching and learning spaces and our roles in students lives. (Richardson, Educational Leadership, 28) New technologies can expand the contact hours we have with our students and how we get to know them. Social bookmarking sites allow one to save links, organize them through annotating them with tags, and sharing them with all those who have the same tag. Social bookmarking lets us read and connect what others read. You can use sites like delicious.com to form Jewish special interest groups among students in different grades, schools or towns. Try joining a social networking site like Facebook to communicate with and get to know your students.\nIdentity Formation Technology is also impacting identity formation in teens. There is more experimentation and reinvention of identity and different modes of expression. However, studies of online identity formation consistently suggest that young people tend to express their personal and social identities online much as people always have in real space and in ways that are consistent with their identities in real space (Palfrey and Gasser, 21) Greater exploration offers terrific possibilities for personal development.\nTechnology tool: Allow students to create and share photo essays that represent their Jewish identities using online photo galleries like Photobucket or Flickr.\nMoral Development We often hear the difficulty students sometimes have in finding ways Judaism and Jewish values are relevant to the modern world. What more relevant conversation to have with teens than on how the ways we use technology can exhibit or conflict with Jewish values? There are rich discussions that can be had on making good choices about technology use such as: downloading materially legally; resisting violent or sexually inappropriate material online or in video games; limiting time online to have time for community, family, and self; the downside of multitasking and warning signs of addiction; and guarding against inappropriate ways of relating to others like sexting or cyber-bullying. Our ancient rabbis confronted the societal issues that are facing our teens today even though they could not have foreseen the digital age. Our role as teachers can be the pathfinders for our teens and their parents to help them Jewishly navigate the digital world.\nTechnology tool: A wiki is practically an online Talmud pagea collaborative webspace where anyone can add content or edit what has already been published. Wikis use skills of creation, collaboration, and contribution. Pose an ethical challenge from the real world and task students with finding relevant Jewish sources as well as posting their own commentary.\nMultitasking and Down Time Multitasking for a digital native is using more than one type of media at a time. It is not uncommon to find teens on a social networking site instant messaging friends, listening to downloaded music and doing homework. Multitasking takes different forms. Parallel processing is when we do more than one thing at exactly the same timereading while listening to music. Task-switching occurs when we rapidly change from one task to anotherreading a book and responding to instant messages as they appear. (Gasser and Palfrey, Educational Leadership, 17). It is task-switching that teens engage in most often. Research suggests that multitasking does not make learning impossible, but it does increase the amount of time needed to finish a task. In addition, the loss of attention and the time spent switching tasks may have an adverse effect on digital natives ability to learn complex new facts and concepts. (Gasser and Palfrey, Educational Leadership, 18)\nTechnology tool: Experiment with different environments in your classroom. Allow students to select and listen to relevant music while they study with a partner. Alternatively, declare some time or classroom space quiet or unplugged and teach students that there are appropriate times to focus and turn our digital devices off. Tie in to the idea of Shabbat and teach that we all need a break; practice quiet time and meditation.",

Here may be a list of different toxic foods.\n- *Is Garlic Healthy or Toxic for Dogs?\n- Naturaldoghealthremedies.com claims that garlic boosts immunities, fights infection, enhances liver perform, lowers blood fats, and repels ticks and fleas, nevertheless cautions that giant doses given to dogs on a daily basis will cause oxidative injury to red blood cells resulting in Heinz-body anemia and even death. They additionally caution that puppies below the age of eight weeks, dogs scheduled for surgery, and people with pre-existing anemia mustn't be given garlic.\n- Dr's Foster and Smith of peteducation.com are in agreement that garlic causes a breakdown of red blood cells in dogs though they permit that garlic in terribly tiny amounts in some industrial pet foods has not been shown to cause any issues. Their web site states that a toxic dose is unknown which cats are a lot of sensitive to garlic than dogs are.\n- Wikipedia says that green or un-ripened tomatoes should not be included in your dog's diet as a result they contain ptomaine, that is harmful to our pets; however red tomatoes are fine.\n- It says that moldy food may also create dangerous dog treats.\n- Small balls, toys, and chicken or turkey bones will be choked on by dogs. Cooked bones also are too brittle for a dog to eat safely - it's safer to stay to raw bones.\n- If your dog eats an excessive amount of food, obesity can develop which may be fatal.\n- If you're thinking that you pet has been poisoned by one among the on top of foods, then call your vet or the Emergency Vet - particularly if he's vomiting or showing signs of lethargy.\n- How sick he could get can relies on the amount ingested. My pet has had tiny amounts of onion and garlic and it hasn't caused any issues. He once additionally stole an After-Eight! Mint, once more - this was simply a tiny low quantity of chocolate therefore he was fine. However it will pay to stay an eye fixed out - and keep the incorrect style of dangerous ingredients out of reach.\n- As well as these dangerous foods, there are different ingredients that will not be terribly healthy for your pet. Dog food allergies will be caused by things like wheat or diary product. And similar to humans - an excessive amount of sugar can create an overweight pet.\n- Grapes and Raisins\n- Macadamia nuts\n- Seeds (such as apple seeds)\n- Turkey skin\n- Green or sprouting potato skins\n- Apricot – Stone\n- Apple – Seeds\n- Cherry – Seeds\n- Peach Stone\n- There are voluminous safe foods which will be used to create simple homemade dog treats. A few things, like pumpkin for dogs will truly be a super food.\n- It is simple to keep your pet safe and healthy once you recognize what to avoid.

    "London: Scientists claim to have finally solved the mystery why zebras evolved their distinctive black and white stripes - to keep blood-sucking flies at bay.\nResearchers from Hungary and Sweden, who detailed their study in the Journal of Experimental Biology, said that this pattern of narrow stripes makes zebras \"unattractive\" to the flies.\nAnd the key to this effect is in how the striped patterns reflect light, said Susanne Akesson, from Lund University in Sweden, a member of the international team that carried out the study.\nAccording to researchers, this pattern of narrow stripes makes zebras \\\"unattractive\\\" to the flies.\n\"We started off studying horses with black, brown or white coats. We found that in the black and brown horses, we get horizontally polarised light,\" Akesson was quoted as saying by the BBC News.\nThis effect made the dark-coloured horses very attractive to flies, she said.\nIt means the light that bounces off the horse's dark coat - and travels in waves to the eyes of a hungry fly - moves along a horizontal plane, like a snake slithering along with its body flat to the floor.\nThe team found that horseflies, or tabanids, were very attracted by these \"flat\" waves of light. \"From a white coat, you get unpolarised light reflected,\" Dr Akesson explained.\nUnpolarised light waves travel along any and every plane, and are much less attractive to flies. As a result, white coated horses are much less troubled by horseflies than their dark-coloured relatives, the researchers pointed out.\nHaving discovered the flies' preference for dark coats, the team then became interested in zebras. They wanted to know what kind of light would bounce off the body of a zebra, and how this would affect the biting flies that are a horse's most irritating enemy.\nThey placed a blackboard, a whiteboard and several boards with stripes of varying widths at a field in Hungary. \"We put insect glue on the boards and counted the number of flies that each one attracted,\" Dr Akesson said.\nIt was found that the striped board that was the closest match to the actual pattern of a zebra's coat attracted by far the fewest flies, even less than the white boards that were reflecting unpolarised light, she said.",
    "I’m struggling a bit to teach my children to pack for themselves. I want them to learn how to be self-reliant, but I also want to make sure they have everything they need for the day. If I don’t triple check every detail, they’re likely to be fully prepared for snack time but missing important papers or sports equipment. What’s the right thing to do?\nYour desire to raise self-reliant children is fantastic. But there’s no doubt that passing the baton can be tough. The first question has to be: how old are your children? A good general rule of thumb is, if they’re old enough to read, they’re old enough to pack their own bags. Assuming your little ones are old enough, the most effective thing to do is give them some time frame to take complete responsibility for getting themselves ready, ask questions to help prompt them if you think they aren’t paying attention to something crucial, and most importantly, when things aren’t crucial (e.g. do they have the right uniform packed), letting them fail. Nothing teaches quite like experience. As you let go of the reigns a bit, here are some more ideas to guide you.\n• Planning Starts the Night Before. Mornings are not the right time to teach your children how to pack themselves. You’re rushed, and they’re often bleary-eyed and grumpy. The ideal time to sit down with them, explain what you are trying to accomplish, and get them to start preparing for the next day is after homework but before TV time. That way you have time to ask them questions and offer un-stressed help in the initial stages. This is a process that will take time and spending time in the evenings helping them learn how to become responsible for themselves is time well spent.\n• Explain as You Go. You need to develop a checklist with them and then go through the items. Don’t criticize or watch over the task being done. Accept that the task will not be done exactly the way you would do it but recognize that as long as it is accomplished and done on time, that it is okay. In the beginning, be prepared to patiently ask and answer a lot of questions! Why do emergency numbers need to be in the backpacks? Because you might need to call someone. Why does lunch have to be prepared? So that mom knows they are eating healthy and, besides, too much sugar will make them feel bad, Why do you keep asking about permission slips or projects that need to go with them? Because it’s important they do not miss out on something the rest of the class is doing. This is just a primer but you get the idea.\n• Provide Feedback. Once the task has been completed, give constructive feedback to the person. As a guideline, tell your son or daughter five great things about the job for every one criticism. If after some time you notice they are consistently sloppy or forgetful, be patient but firm and make sure there are consequences for actions.",
    "A not-so-hard graft\nTransplantable blood vessels can now be grown as desired\nANOTHER advance in the emerging technology of regenerative medicine has just been announced. It should soon be possible to make blood vessels that can be stored and used “off the shelf” for surgery that requires arteries or veins to be bypassed. The vessels, prototypes of which are described this week in a paper in Science Translational Medicine, are made by Humacyte, a small firm based in Durham, North Carolina, that was founded by Shannon Dahl, the paper's principal author, and two colleagues.\nThe recipe Dr Dahl and her colleagues concocted begins with smooth-muscle cells. Smooth muscle is different from the familiar sort that cloaks bones and enables bodily movement. It is a component of organs such as the gut and the blood vessels that sometimes need to change shape while they are functioning.\nTo make artificial blood vessels the team took smooth-muscle cells from fresh corpses and cultured them on tubular scaffolds made of a material called polyglycolic acid. Grown this way, smooth muscle secretes collagen, a structural protein that is, among several other things in the body, an important component of the walls of blood vessels. The polyglycolic acid degrades spontaneously over the course of a few weeks with the consequence that it is, in effect, replaced by the collagen. The result is a tube of the length and diameter of the original scaffold, that is composed of collagen and smooth-muscle cells—a structure similar to a natural blood vessel.\nTransplanting that into a patient, however, would risk provoking an immune reaction, since the muscle cells are “foreign” tissue. To get around this, Dr Dahl and her colleagues wash the muscle cells away with a detergent, leaving just the collagen. Though the end product is a nonliving simulacrum of a blood vessel rather than an artificial version of the real, biologically active thing, experiments on animals suggest that it works well enough to substitute for a diseased natural vessel (for example, a clogged coronary artery that might otherwise cause a heart attack). It can also act as a “tap” from which the blood of people whose kidneys have failed might be drawn for dialysis.\nAt the moment, the options for either of these things are limited. The best approach is to use a length of vessel taken from elsewhere in the patient's body (commonly, his leg). But that requires such transplants to be healthy themselves—and each length of transplanted vessel can be used only once. Synthetic vessels made of Teflon exist, but they are prone to infection and blockage by blood clots, and tend to work for only a few months.\nThe animal experiments suggest the new, all-collagen vessels are capable of lasting at least a year without noticeable deterioration. They are also, once implanted, able to remodel themselves in ways that improve their function—changing shape in response to blood flow, being colonised by cells from the patient's body, and showing signs of incorporating elastin, another structural protein found in natural vessels.\nAlso, if kept in a suitable saline buffer at 4°C, they can be transplanted a year after they were made without a perceptible degradation of their properties. So, if human trials confirm these results, the surgical-repairer's toolkit will have acquired a useful additional instrument—and the age of the cyborg will be just that little bit nearer.\nFrom the print edition: Science and technology",
    "The Invisible Minority\nThe National Education Association has a long, proud legacy of advocating for great public schools for every student, including English language learners. Educational, socio-economic, and sociocultural factors facing English language learners (ELLs) and NEA members are more important now than ever. The future of our members is closely tied to the educational outcomes of ELLs.\nNEA cares about ELLs because our members:\nIn 1966, the National Education Association’s Department of Rural Education released a report entitled, “The Invisible Minority: Report of the NEA-Tucson Survey On the Teaching of Spanish to the Spanish-Speaking.” The opening page contains the following quote from Thomas Jefferson to his nephew Peter Carr in 1787.\n“Bestow great attention on Spanish and endeavor to acquire an accurate knowledge of it. Our future connections with Spain and Spanish America will render that language of valuable acquisition. The ancient history of that part of America, too, is written in that language. I am sending you a dictionary.”\nSince 1787, the number of languages other than English spoken in the U.S. has increased significantly, as has the number of people in the U.S. who speak languages other than English. This is a trend that educators experience today in schools throughout the country.\nThe enrollment growth rate far outpaces that of PK-12 enrollment. The foresight of Thomas Jefferson in his note to his nephew and that of NEA’s commissioning of this important report are more prescient today as the population of native/heritage language speakers is expected to increase to more than half of the total U.S. population by the year 2050.",

    "(SOURCE: University of Colorado Cancer Center, news release, Sept. 24, 2012)\nSUNDAY, Sept. 30 (HealthDay News) -- Mailing sun-protection kits, which contain information about the dangers of exposure to the sun's harmful UV rays and skin cancer, as well as swim shirts, hats and sunscreen, increases the number of people who take steps to protect their children from sun exposure, according to a new study.\nResearchers from the Colorado School of Public Health and the University of Colorado Cancer Center found that the kits prompted more people to provide their kids with sun-protective clothing, hats and sunscreen. The kits also encouraged more people to avoid midday sun.\nThe investigators noted that because the kits were inexpensive and delivered by mail, they could be widely distributed.\n\"This is a low-cost, effective intervention that could be an important component in efforts to reduce sun exposure in children during the years that they acquire much of their risk for skin cancer,\" the study's first author, Lori Crane, investigator at the Cancer Center and chair of the department of community and behavioral health at the Colorado School of Public Health, said in a news release from the center.\nThe study involved 676 children, all 6-year-olds, and their parents. All participants were surveyed to assess their level of sun-protective behaviors as well as parents' knowledge about melanoma and their understanding of their child's lifetime risk for this form of skin cancer. Skin exams also revealed the children's level of tanning and number of potentially dangerous moles they had. Half of the participating families were randomly selected to receive sun-protection kits in the mail in April and May of 2005, 2006 and 2007.\nThe study, published in the October issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, revealed that those who received the sun-protection kits gained more awareness about sun exposure and had greater adherence to sun-protective behaviors. The most significant behavioral changes the people reported were those emphasized in each yearly kit, the researchers noted.\n\"After we emphasized long clothing in the spring of 2005, we saw a difference in clothing behavior in the summers of 2005 and 2006, not in 2007. Then after emphasizing hats in 2006, we saw a difference in hat use that year. And then after highlighting shade in 2007, we saw a corresponding increase in parents' awareness and use of shade as a sun-protective behavior,\" Crane explained in the news release.\nMore research is needed to determine how the kits affect children's risk for skin cancer and if it changes behavior in the long term, the study authors added.\nThe researchers warned in the news release that children and teens who develop a blistering sunburn have a more than doubled risk of skin cancer in adulthood, and long-term sun exposure accumulated over many years may be equally harmful.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about sun protection.\nCopyright © 2013 ScoutNews, LLC.

    "To explicitly (as in communism and Islam), or implicitly (as in our own democratic system and Christianity) claim that man’s morality is a function of obeying the Law (which necessarily demands of man his property and time, to be taken not asked for, as we can clearly see ) is to claim that man’s natural state is Evil. For it says that man’s sole moral purpose is to subordinate the very thing that separate’s him from the beasts, and makes him man: his conscious will.\nFurther, if the Law is what makes man good, then of what use is the Law to man or man to the Law? For the implicit or explicit claim is that man, himself, alone, is utterly evil; and therefore how can what is good, the Law, make man good if man is utterly evil?\nIt can’t. Because absolute evil is by definition exclusive of what is good. It cannot be made good without contradicting itself.\nTherefore, if man can be made good by the Law–his obedience thereto–then man is, himself, NOT actually evil. It is impossible that he should be in any way labeled an immoral creature at the natural level without ALSO nullifying the Law as a rational moral standard. And if man is not an immoral creature at the natural level then his morality is not a function of the Law, but a function of his nature–of himself. And this too nullifies the Law as any rational moral standard.\nAny attempt then to create a moral society by obligating man to the Law will fail.

    "By Yuliya Chernova\nThis spring a sea-gliding robot deployed by start-up Liquid Robotics to collect data in the Gulf of Mexico sent an alarming text message to its pilot ashore that something was wrong.\nThe pilot, who remotely guides the robot on its mission — in this case to collect data on water chemistry, current information, and acoustics for BP PLC — directed it to take underwater pictures of itself. The acoustic instrument had tangled up. It was time to return to port.\nOnce the robot was back on firm ground, the Liquid Robotics crew found the culprit. The underwater glider, which the robot uses to propel itself under water without the use of any fuel, had bite marks on it. “It was attacked by a shark with about a 12 to 14-inch size bite from the shape of the tooth marks on the gliders fins,” said Bill Vass, the company’s new CEO, who hails from years in the computer industry as a high level executive at Sun Microsystems.\nThankfully, he noted, after 150,000 combined miles at sea with the company’s robots, this was the only shark attack.\n“How often in a start-up do you get to say, ‘a shark just attacked my robot,” Vass said.\nThe robot is back on another mission in the Gulf, about a hundred miles offshore, and is expected to be at sea for another 120 days.\nLiquid Robotics’ Wave Gliders have the unique ability to travel for months, years even, across the world’s oceans without having to refuel. They are designed to convert the power of waves mechanically to propel themselves.\nThis opens up ocean exploration in a way previously unthinkable, said Alan Salzman, who joined the company’s board as a result of a $22 million round of financing the start-up recently raised. The round, which also included small investments from oilfield services company Schlumberger Ltd. and Stanford University, valued the company at about $70 million, including cash on hand, Vass said.\nThe promise of clean technology is not just in new power-generation, said Salzman, but in applications beyond that. Besides helping BP evaluate water quality in the Gulf, the Wave Gliders are traveling to other disaster sites. They are going to Japan, for example, to measure radiation in the waters there, Vass said.\nOther applications are security and weather-related. “A few governments have asked for a “picket fence” application,” Vass said. “For example, having a grid of a thousand robots along their coast tracking ships and subs in their waters as well as looking for a tsunami.”\nThis is not a nonprofit endeavor. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company expects to have revenue of about $13 million to $14 million this year. It has about 60 robots deployed now.\nThe primary business model for Liquid Robotics is to deploy robots and sell data they collect. Each annual contract would provide about $500,000, Vass said. The beauty of its business model is that the company could use the same robot, mount various instruments on it, and sell different data to several customers while keeping operating and capital costs nearly stable.\nThe CEO declined to specify exactly how much it costs to operate and make the robots, but said: “The robots use no fuel, have no crew, have very low liability insurance requirements, and low maintenance costs because of the simplicity of the design,” said the CEO.\nWhen Vass first saw a video of how the glider is made, he said “it was like the invention of the wheel. It was so obvious and beautiful, the way it operated.”\nThe company was co-founded in 2007 by Roger Hine, who is now chief technical officer.\nFor Vass, turning from the world of Sun Microsystems to the ocean was in some ways a return to what he has done many years ago. “In a galaxy far, far away,” he said, he was a merchant marine, wrote software that was used to design submarines and ships, worked offshore on geoseismic vessels, and worked for Western Geophysical as a data processor and programmer.",
    "Good global governance (GGG) is transparent, trustworthy and just. It is based on four pillars:\n- Global Legislative Powers\n- Global Judicial Powers\n- Global Executive Powers\n- Effective Public Administration.\nThe United Nations System does not have all these elements yet; it is in need of substantial overhaul or regeneration before it can supply Good Global Governance. We believe that in today’s world Good Global Governance is not only meaningful and technically feasible, it has even become necessary.\nHistorically the size of governed entities has increased from tribes to nations to regional unions. Today, communication and transportation technology make good governance on a global scale feasible. In fact, Good Global Governance has become a necessity since a war with nuclear weapons can lead to mutual assured destruction. Therefore, we need a World Authority that can bring terrorists and war criminals to justice. Furthermore, Good Global Governance is needed for the protection of the global commons and for the solution of numerous related sustainability issues of global scope: climate change, resource scarcity, world population growth, poverty and hunger, terrorism, corruption of the banking system, to name a few.\nThe complexity of global issues requires a multi-level government system. Governance is needed for households, municipalities, sub-national units, nations, supra-national regions and for the whole World. According to the principle of subsidiarity each level solves its own problems with little interference from above. Nations should be internally sovereign. When well governed, they enjoy internal peace. While Good Global Governance is not a centralized ‘Big Brother’ control system, it offers world peace by limiting the external sovereignty of nations through enforcing world law.",
    "by Gerry Everding\nSt. Louis MO (SPX) Feb 12, 2013\nNominated early this year for recognition on the UNESCO World Heritage List, which includes such famous cultural sites as the Taj Mahal, Machu Picchu and Stonehenge, the earthen works at Poverty Point, La., have been described as one of the world's greatest feats of construction by an archaic civilization of hunters and gatherers.\nNow, new research in the current issue of the journal Geoarchaeology, offers compelling evidence that one of the massive earthen mounds at Poverty Point was constructed in less than 90 days, and perhaps as quickly as 30 days - an incredible accomplishment for what was thought to be a loosely organized society consisting of small, widely scattered bands of foragers.\n\"What's extraordinary about these findings is that it provides some of the first evidence that early American hunter-gatherers were not as simplistic as we've tended to imagine,\" says study co-author T.R. Kidder, PhD, professor and chair of anthropology in Arts and Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\"Our findings go against what has long been considered the academic consensus on hunter-gather societies - that they lack the political organization necessary to bring together so many people to complete a labor-intensive project in such a short period.\"\nCo-authored by Anthony Ortmann, PhD, assistant professor of geosciences at Murray State University in Kentucky, the study offers a detailed analysis of how the massive mound was constructed some 3,200 years ago along a Mississippi River bayou in northeastern Louisiana.\nBased on more than a decade of excavations, core samplings and sophisticated sedimentary analysis, the study's key assertion is that Mound A at Poverty Point had to have been built in a very short period because an exhaustive examination reveals no signs of rainfall or erosion during its construction.\n\"We're talking about an area of northern Louisiana that now tends to receive a great deal of rainfall,\" Kidder says. \"Even in a very dry year, it would seem very unlikely that this location could go more than 90 days without experiencing some significant level of rainfall. Yet, the soil in these mounds shows no sign of erosion taking place during the construction period. There is no evidence from the region of an epic drought at this time, either.\"\nPart of a much larger complex of earthen works at Poverty Point, Mound A is believed to be the final and crowning addition to the sprawling 700-acre site, which includes five smaller mounds and a series of six concentric C-shaped embankments that rise in parallel formation surrounding a small flat plaza along the river. At the time of construction, Poverty Point was the largest earthworks in North America.\nBuilt on the western edge of the complex, Mound A covers about 538,000 square feet [roughly 50,000 square meters] at its base and rises 72 feet above the river. Its construction required an estimated 238,500 cubic meters - about eight million bushel baskets - of soil to be brought in from various locations near the site. Kidder figures it would take a modern, 10-wheel dump truck about 31,217 loads to move that much dirt today.\n\"The Poverty Point mounds were built by people who had no access to domesticated draft animals, no wheelbarrows, no sophisticated tools for moving earth,\" Kidder explains. \"It's likely that these mounds were built using a simple 'bucket brigade' system, with thousands of people passing soil along from one to another using some form of crude container, such as a woven basket, a hide sack or a wooden platter.\"\nTo complete such a task within 90 days, the study estimates it would require the full attention of some 3,000 laborers. Assuming that each worker may have been accompanied by at least two other family members, say a wife and a child, the community gathered for the build must have included as many as 9,000 people, the study suggests.\n\"Given that a band of 25-30 people is considered quite large for most hunter-gatherer communities, it's truly amazing that this ancient society could bring together a group of nearly 10,000 people, find some way to feed them and get this mound built in a matter of months,\" Kidder says.\nSoil testing indicates that the mound is located on top of land that was once low-lying swamp or marsh land - evidence of ancient tree roots and swamp life still exists in undisturbed soils at the base of the mound. Tests confirm that the site was first cleared for construction by burning and quickly covered with a layer of fine silt soil. A mix of other heavier soils then were brought in and dumped in small adjacent piles, gradually building the mound layer upon layer.\nAs Kidder notes, previous theories about the construction of most of the world's ancient earthen mounds have suggested that they were laid down slowly over a period of hundreds of years involving small contributions of material from many different people spanning generations of a society. While this may be the case for other earthen structures at Poverty Point, the evidence from Mound A offers a sharp departure from this accretional theory. Kidder's home base in St.\nLouis is just across the Mississippi River from one of America's best known ancient earthen structures, the Monk Mound at Cahokia, Ill. He notes that the Monk Mound was built many centuries later than the mounds at Poverty Point by a civilization that was much more reliant on agriculture, a far cry from the hunter-gatherer group that built Poverty Point. Even so, Mound A at Poverty Point is much larger than almost any other mound found in North America; only Monk's Mound at Cahokia is larger.\n\"We've come to realize that the social fabric of these socieites must have been much stronger and more complex that we might previously have given them credit. These results contradict the popular notion that pre-agricultural people were socially, politically, and economically simple and unable to organize themselves into large groups that could build elaborate architecture or engage in so-called complex social behavior,\" Kidder says.\n\"The prevailing model of hunter-gatherers living a life 'nasty, brutish and short' is contradicted and our work indicates these people were practicing a sophisticated ritual/religious life that involved building these monumental mounds.\"\nWashington University in St. Louis\nAll About Human Beings and How We Got To Be Here\n|The content herein, unless otherwise known to be public domain, are Copyright 1995-2012 - Space Media Network.

    "WASHINGTON - Not all calories are equal. A new study suggests that a diet based on healthy carbohydrates provides the best chance of dropping pounds without side effects.\nResearchers compared three different diets: healthy carbs, low carbs and low fat. The study, which appears in The Journal of the American Medical Association, found that people on the low-fat diet burned fewer calories. While the low-carb diet -- similar to the Atkins diet -- burned the most calories, it increased a stress hormone and inflammation, possibly raising the risk of heart disease and diabetes.\nThe healthy-carb diet, or low-glycemic-index diet, burned 150 calories a day more than the low-fat diet, without negative effects on cholesterol levels. The diet is similar to the Mediterranean diet, which includes lots of fresh vegetables and whole grains.\nDr. David Ludwig, one of the study's authors and director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital, says the findings suggest the low-glycemic diet overall is the best for people trying to lose weight without side effects that can undermine their health.\n\"We should avoid severely restricting any major nutrient and focus on the quality of the nutrient, \" he said, referring to the limitations of a low-fat diet, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.\nA separate study includes a warning about the Atkins diet of low carbs and high protein.\nSwedish researchers say people on an extreme \"Atkins-style\" diet are increasing their risk of potentially fatal heart disease and strokes.\nThe risk to young women is especially high.\nResearchers found an extra four to five cases of cardiovascular disease per 10,000 women per year, for those on such diets, The Mirror reports.\n\"Don't feel you have to choose between carbohydrates or protein - a bit of both is better for your long term heart health.\" Victoria Taylor, senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, told the Mirror.\n(Copyright 2012 by WTOP.

    "Those were also the days of Edmund Gosse’s terrible childhood.\nNo fiction of any kind, religious or secular, was admitted into the house. In this it was to my Mother, not to my Father, that the prohibition was due. She had a remarkable, I confess to me still somewhat unaccountable impression that to 'tell a story', that is, to compose fictitious narrative of any kind, was a sin. - Gosse, Father and Son (1907)\nThough Gosse was a child in the 1850s, his upbringing was a sign of things to come. By the 1860s, certain types of fiction were considered incredibly dangerous, especially the sensation novel. Drawing from gothic and romantic literary fiction, the sensation novel appealed to the uncultured masses through shocking themes, like adultery, theft, kidnapping, insanity, bigamy, forgery, seduction, and murder. Other than relying on shock and awe, sensation novels separated themselves from other more respectable genres by using common settings familiar to their poorer middle- and working- class audiences.\nBy the 1880s, the sensation novel was replaced by the ‘penny dreadful,’ known as ‘dime novels’ in the United States. Stanford's Dime Novel and Story Paper Collection celebrates the era, which “benefited from three mutually reinforcing trends: the vastly increased mechanization of printing, the growth of efficient rail and canal shipping, and ever-growing rates of literacy.”\nI’ve always thought of these as serial novels, published in story-based (I hesitate to use the word literary) publications. Again, their low price made them accessible to the uncultured reading masses, filling their minds with the kind of trash Mother Gosse sought to protect her son from in the 1850s.\nIn the 1890s, the British newspaper and publishing magnate, Alfred Harmsworth, decided to take on the corrupting influence of the penny dreadfuls, but wound up creating the same thing for less: The Half-penny Marvel, The Union Jack and Pluck, all priced at a half-penny. A.A. Milne once said, \"Harmsworth killed the penny dreadful by the simple process of producing the ha'penny dreadfuller.\" But Harmsworth made some thing wonderful happen.\nMeet Sexton Blake, who, in the 1890s, was known as “the poor man’s Sherlock Holmes.” Though written by many hands (Harmsworth owned the rights), the first Sexton Blake story, “The Missing Millionaire,” was published on 20 December 1893 and really sought to capitalize on the popularity of Sherlock Holmes, who Arthur Conan Doyle was already getting tired of writing about.\nLike Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake was a consulting detective operating out of Baker Street. Blake’s Watson is called Tinker, who didn’t appear until 1904 and is more like Batman’s Robin. Blake’s love interest is Yvone Cartier and his housekeeper is Mrs. Bardell. Blake is a little more clean-cut than Holmes, but is actually an educated medical doctor, like the real Sherlock Holmes.\nThe Sexton Blake franchise continued on through the 1960s and the official fan website calls for a revival in the 21st century.\nSo why was Sherlock Holmes considered literature, while Sexton Blake was considered trashy? My focus is on the 1890s, so I’m not going to comment on what might have happened to the franchise in the 20th century, but the fact that it actually was a franchise might have had something to do with it. Maybe having multiple authors had something to do with it? During my undergraduate degree, I took a class, in which we read novels of many shapes, my fellow students found that they had a lower opinion of what a book would be like, based on its shape. If it looked like a Harlequin romance book, they expected it to be trashy. They were often surprised by what they found inside. Maybe readers in the 1890s didn’t take Blake seriously because of the cheap quality of the publications?",
    "Recent acts of violence alongside pending legislation and international pressure have brought to light the pressing need for lawmaking in support of LGBT rights in Chile. Together with protests for reforms in the education system, the public seems to be increasingly impatient about what the government is doing to protect LGBT rights. These demands are important beyond the scope of gay rights, because they have brought attention to the need for Chile to recognize, accept and protect the human rights of an evolving, heterogeneous culture as a fundamental prerequisite for continued prosperity.\nThe passage of an antidiscrimination law, which remained unresolved for over seven years, by a close 58-56 vote in the Chamber of Deputies this month was a basic necessity for the country. The Chilean Movement for Sexual Minorities (MOVILH) notes that in 2011 gay, lesbian and transgender Chileans were increasingly outspoken in reporting abuse and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. However, this recently passed antidiscrimination law does not deal with hate crimes per se, but rather defines illegal discrimination. Furthermore, certain passages have yet to be finalized in a mixed commission of Senators and Deputies on May 2. The recent death of gay youth Daniel Zamudio points to precisely why legislating solely on discrimination does not suffice in this case, serving as an exceptionally violent example as to why hate crimes require specific punishment under the law.\nZamudio received not only the public’s sympathy, but also worldwide attention including a briefing note from the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights’ spokesman, Rupert Colville, urging Chile to enact hate crime legislation. In this regard, the MOVILH also argues that Chilean society is not opposed to legislating on issues of gay rights and antidiscrimination in its entirety, but there is a lack of bravery and willingness within Congress to approach these pending issues. The recent Inter-American Court of Human Rights’ overturning of a Chilean court ruling against lesbian Judge Karen Atala, who lost custody of her children because of her same-sex relationship, is further international pressure for Chile to meet requirements stipulated by international agreements it has signed onto.\nChile’s gay rights deficit is worrying as the country continues to be viewed as an example for continued economic growth despite global market volatility. President Sebastian Piñera’s administration is cautious about giving into all public demands, as Chile’s Minister of Finance Felipe Larraín recently said: “If we surrender to the temptation of appeasing demands by giving in to all of them, we will never get to our final goal [development].” However, most gay rights issues rely merely on political willingness rather than investment for social welfare. Furthermore, acting on gay rights is not the investment equivalent of reforming a public education system.\nOn the contrary, the lack of legislative initiative to protect gay Chileans is hindering the business community’s business opportunities. Private initiatives have been taken to reach out to gay customers, like for example the granting of access to mortgages and family insurance plans to Banco de Chile customers in same-sex relationships, proving how it is not only the public that is restless, but also the private sector that recognizes the positive effects of social inclusion in business. What could potentially prove threatening to Chile’s continued economic success might just be the lack of recognition given to the longstanding need for social inclusion of minorities in the country’s legal framework. In contrast, Chile’s neighbor Argentina has clearly reaped the benefits of gay tourism and investment since legislating on gay marriage, while Chile continues to turn a blind eye to opportunity.\nThis is not to say that Piñera’s administration has not taken basic steps to promote the rights of gay couples, like for example Piñera’s public presentation of a civil unions bill in August 2011. However, this legislative project was not only perceived as a political tool in the midst of cabinet discussions with student protest leaders, but is also minimal when considering the prominent use of gay couples in campaign ads for Sebastian Piñera during his presidential campaign. For this reason, the inclusion of a question in the 2012 census that allows gay couples to state whether they live with a same-sex partner may become an important, confidential and unbiased figure that current and future administrations could use to advocate for legislation on gay unions.\nThis paradox persists despite the heightened quality of life of Chileans. Economic growth is creating an increasingly obvious deficit in basic human rights the country has yet to attain. In spite of continued development and well-regarded fiscal policy through the recession and into today’s administration, Chile continues to be in debt to not only its citizens and the country’s business community, but also to international human rights agreements on sexual orientation and gender identity. These international standards continue to be well above those demonstrated by the current state of gay rights legislation in Chile.\nEduardo Ayala is a guest blogger to AQ Online.

    "By ROBERT LANGRETH and JOHN LAUERMAN\nApril Hauge, a nurse practitioner in Weimar, Calif., spent $500 on a genetic test for her autistic son in 2009 that led to purchasing thousands of dollars in vitamins and supplements. Impressed with the results, she’s now selling advice on the approach to others. There’s just one problem: the DNA tests and related treatments have scant backing from science and U.S. government officials. They’re untested, unproven, and may constitute “health fraud,” doctors, regulators and concerned parents said.\nFor alternative-medicine providers in general, the genetic tests are nothing but a “marketing tool” to sell unproven treatments, said James Laidler, a retired physician and adjunct professor at Portland State University whose 19-year-old autistic son has tried alternative therapies.\n“You always hear the testimonials from the people who got better, not the people who stayed the same or got worse,” Laidler said. “They don’t want to hear somebody saying this is snake oil.”\nDoctors and clinics across the United States are using the exploding science of DNA testing to feed anxieties and sell hope to people with autism and other hard-to-treat disorders. Emboldened by meager state and federal regulation, purveyors of alternative medicine offer genetic tests costing hundreds of dollars to worried parents and patients, and then sell advice on supplements and diet based on results purporting to spot disease-causing deficiencies. They claim to be the panacea for everything from autism to chronic fatigue syndrome to the effects of aging.\n“A lot of this skims on the edge of health fraud,” said Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration, referring to the use of DNA testing to recommend alternative therapies.\nMapping the genome is becoming a standard tool of medical care, with new and cheaper DNA sequencing machines helping doctors unravel inherited diseases that once took years to diagnose. By searching for mutated genes in tumors, doctors can sometimes target them with special drugs that counteract the effect of rogue genes.\nAfter saying for about a decade that it has the power to regulate genetic testing, the FDA has yet to exercise its authority for most DNA diagnostics. While the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regulates testing labs, it doesn’t ensure that the tests are medically significant, or that doctors use them appropriately.\nAlberto Gutierrez, director of the office of in vitro diagnostics and radiological health at the FDA, said the agency is “very concerned” about complex genetic tests being sold by laboratories, often over the Internet, whose claims are difficult to evaluate. Often, it may be difficult to even know who did the testing, he said.\n“Nobody has looked at the evidence to support these tests,” said Gutierrez. “I am concerned that patients are being given unproven information that may result in less than optimal management of their disease.”\nFollowing public hearings in July 2010, the agency developed guidance for regulating complex genetic and other tests sold by laboratories. The rules have been under review by the Obama administration since late 2011, he said. Until they are finalized, the agency is “somewhat hamstrung” in cracking down on companies that sell the tests, Gutierrez said.\nIn the meantime, patients and doctors “should proceed with caution” as some of the tests have not been well validated, Gutierrez said.\nThe vast majority of laboratory genetic tests provide valid medical information and are processed accurately and responsibly by licensed professionals, said Alan Mertz, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, a Washington-based industry group. Some doctors use valid tests to support “fringe” medicine, he said.\n“The lab is just performing the genetic tests and reporting what the genetic makeup is of that DNA,” he said. “They don’t know whether it’s being used to prescribe supplements. They may have no idea what the doctor does with the information.”",

    "The United Nations Convention on Narcotic Drugs readmitted Bolivia into its fold on Friday, universally recognizing the right of Bolivians to chew the coca leaf. This gives President Evo Morales one of his most important victories thus far in his global efforts to decriminalize the coca leaf.\nBolivia had voluntary withdrawn from the UN group a year ago because it classified the coca leaf as an \"illicit drug.\" On Friday, however, a majority of the convention's members voted to allow Bolivia back into the committee and also approved a statute which says that chewing the coca leaf is legal within Bolivia's borders.\nIt's a largely symbolic victory, as this UN commission lacks the power to regulate coca leaf consumption in Bolivia in the first place. But the UN declaration has been welcomed by the Bolivian government, which is planning to invite the country's coca growers to massive coca-chewing events in the cities of La Paz and Cochabamba next Monday.\nThe coca leaf is the base material for cocaine. But for centuries indigenous people in the Andean mountains have chewed this leaf in its natural form to gain energy and decrease hunger. Some groups in the region also consider the coca leaf to be a sacred plant, and use it regularly for social and religious rituals.\nEvo Morales, who is himself a former coca grower, has championed the decriminalization of the leaf since he came into office in 2006, chewing coca in international forums, praising its nutritional qualities, and even asking Sean Penn to be his global ambassador for the coca leaf.\nBut the UN's decision to tolerate coca leaf chewing in Bolivia was not well taken by U.S. diplomats, who claim that most of Bolivia's coca crops are being used for cocaine production, and not for traditional chewing.\n\"We oppose Bolivia's reservation and continue to believe it will lead to a greater supply of cocaine,\" a senior U.S. State Department official, told the AP.\n\"While we recognize Bolivia's capacity and willingness to undertake some successful counternarcotics activities, especially in terms of coca eradication, we estimate that much of the coca legally grown in Bolivia is sold to drug traffickers, leading to the conclusion that social control of coca (allowing some legal growing) is not achieving the desired results,\" the official said in a statement.\nOnly a handful of UN member states voted against the readmission of Bolivia into the antinarcotics group. These included big cocaine consumers like the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom, but also Mexico, a key U.S. ally and the main transit point for most cocaine headed to the United States.\nMost member states did not object to Bolivia's readmission into the antinarcotics group or to the new statute which says that chewing, and growing the coca leaf, is fine within Bolivia. The non-objectors included Colombia and Peru which are the world's two biggest cocaine producers and also have very large crops of the coca leaf. U.S. diplomats may want to chew on that dilemma.",
    "Semi-Automatic (or Autoloading) Action\nAs each shot is fired manually, the case of the cartridge or shotshell is ejected automatically and the chamber is reloaded automatically.\n- To open the action, you must pull back the bolt’s operating handle (on a rifle or shotgun) or the slide (on a pistol). Most semi-automatics, when the bolt or slide is pulled back, will lock in the open position if the magazine is empty. If the firearm does not lock open, it means that a cartridge or shotshell from the magazine has gone into the chamber, making the firearm ready to fire. A few semi-automatics do not lock open and must be held open to check the chamber.\n- To unload, first remove the magazine and lock the action open. Then make sure it’s unloaded—visually check the chamber for an additional cartridge or shell.\n- When closing the action for loading, pull back to unlock the bolt or slide and then let go, allowing it to travel forward on its own. Do not guide it forward with your hand because it may not seat properly.\n- On a semi-automatic, the trigger must be pulled each time a shot is fired. This makes the semi-automatic different from the fully-automatic firearm, which fires continuously as long as the trigger is held down. The fully-automatic firearm may not be used for hunting or sport shooting.",
    "Meet the Bombyx Mori in its caterpillar, larva or “worm” state — silkworm to be specific (though it’s not a worm at all).\nThere’s an entire series of videos online showing the Bombyx Mori’s life cycle from egg to larva (small and larger) to pupa to its emergence as an adult moth. But the thing that makes this insect stand out is the silkworm’s creation of a unique cocoon made from its saliva: a one mile long single strand of silk.\nAfter they have molted four times (i.e., in the fifth instar phase), their bodies become slightly yellow and the skin become tighter. The larvae will then enter the pupa phase of their life cycle and enclose themselves in a cocoon made up of raw silk produced by the salivary glands. The cocoon provides a vital layer of protection during the vulnerable, almost motionless pupal state.\nThe moth that emerges from the cocoon is furry, white, doesn’t fly, but of course, starts the cycle all over again.",
    "Ten common myths about teaching\nEducators discuss the nation’s biggest misconceptions about teachers and their profession\nIt seems everyone has an opinion about teachers and their profession these days … and most of them aren’t teachers.\nPerhaps it would be a different matter if the conceptions of teaching were like those of NASA engineers: smart, genius! Or maybe like those of firefighters: brave, self-sacrificing! However, in our nation’s current climate, saying the word “teacher” is like Forrest Gump opening a box of chocolates: you never know what you’re going to get, as teachers too often are seen as a convenient scapegoat for the perceived problems that are plaguing public education.\neSchool News recently asked readers: “If you could clear up one misconception about teachers and/or teaching, what would it be?” Our goal was not only to help others understand these misconceptions, but also to learn how teachers feel they are perceived by others.\nHere are 10 misconceptions about teachers and teaching that emerged from readers (responses edited for brevity):\n1. Those who can’t do, teach.\n“The one misconception I would like to clarify is around the phrase, ‘Those who can cannot do, teach.’ While many educators are active contributors to the particular area in which they have domain expertise (i.e. Science, Language Arts, History), K-12 educators … have committed themselves to developing skills in how to engage and foster growth of young people around the content and processes that comprise that area of expertise. It is the very special practitioner [who] makes a good educator; however, good educators need to have enough knowledge of their areas of expertise to cultivate excitement, curiosity, and spark the passion to commit to a vocation or avocation. Maybe a better phrase is, ‘Those who teach create those who do.’” —Michael Jay\n“One of my favorites is, ‘Those who can’t, teach.’ Teachers must be well educated in their field of study, of course, but that is only the beginning. Teachers need much pedagogical preparation on topics including educational psychology, classroom management, assessment, curriculum instruction, communication skills, and budgeting. And that is all before a teacher steps into a classroom. The requirements for a qualified teacher include all of the skills needed for the 21st-century workplace.” —Mary Montag, teacher, St. Teresa’s Academy",
    "Are you ‘information literate’?\nSee how librarians define the term and challenges – and post your own definition.\nThe term “information literacy” was first penned in a 1974 report by Paul G Zurkowski for the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. He used it to define “the techniques and skills for utilizing the wide range of information tools as well as primary sources in moulding information solutions to their problems.”\nHow do you define information literacy?\nWe invite you to leave your ideas and definitions in the comment section.\nZurkowski also had a term to define the people who applied these skills to their work: the “information literate.”\nOver the last four decades, trouser legs and shirt collars have narrowed, and the meaning of “information literacy” has evolved with the advent of the internet and the speed at which information is delivered. Today, information literacy is at the top of the pyramid of other forms of literacy: traditional literacy, computer literary, digital literacy, library skills, and critical thinking skills according to librarians interviewed by Elsevier.\nIn 2009, on the prompting of the National Forum on Literacy, President Barack Obama proclaimed October National Information Literacy Month. This year, my colleagues and I at Elsevier asked 150 librarians in our online advice community Innovation Explorers to define the term “information literacy.” With their permission, we are posting a few of their responses here:\nWhat is information literacy?\n“Information Literacy is a skill set that allows for fluency with information in our diverse large world,” explained Beth Schuck, Associate University Librarian at Northern Arizona University’s Cline Library. “Many factors influence this including experience with various types of information; location as different cultures use and re-use information in different ways; type of information need also affects Information Literacy skills.\n“Being able to locate and appropriately use information according to the individual’s needs is my notion of Information Literacy,” she concludes.\nIn the words of Stephen Marvin, a Librarian at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, USA, the term now encompasses “reading, understanding, progression, building, assessment, reach, accomplishment, implementation, achievement, knowledge, communication, evaluating, collaborating.”\nSatish Munnolli, a librarian at the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer in Mumbai, India, defines it in terms of how many librarians see their role: “Educating others on how to identify and use the online sources for the authentic and appropriate information in the flood of information.”\nChallenges of imparting literacy\nAs the definition continues to evolve with technology, ensuring library patrons are information literate has its own challenges. Although there are information literacy programs in place at some universities, many others face barriers that limit the level of information literacy available.\nChallenges identified by librarians in Innovation Explorers ranged from the lack of faculty understanding of the concept, limited time in the curriculum to implement and promote a strategy, and the shortage of qualified information literacy instructors at a university.\n“The biggest problem is that people feel they can find everything on Google and don’t search elsewhere, missing a lot of important information,” said Mark Puterbaugh, an Information Services Librarian at Eastern University in Pennsylvania.Realistically, using just one search engine or database for research doesn’t make you information literate. The majority of today’s students are adept at using iPhones, tablets, smart phones and laptops or juggling several social media networks sites to find information, but are they as proficient at finding and using a campus’s resources?\nMary Heinzman, Executive Director of Information Resources at St. Ambrose University in Iowa, USA, summed up the issue by writing: “Information literacy is realizing the need for information and (having) the ability to find, critically evaluate, and appropriately and ethically use information of all kinds in all formats.”\nGetting library patrons to recognize their need for literacy training is just the first step. And the more we agree on definitions and benefits, the closer we are to developing a fully literate population.\nSo while October may be Information Literacy Month, information literacy needs to be applied daily.\nElizabeth Zwaaf is a Marketing Communications Specialist at Elsevier. In this role she helps to promote the work of the Innovation Explorers community to a wider audience at Elsevier and in the research community. She is currently heading up an internal campaign that focuses on where Elsevier gets customer feedback and how it’s used.",
    "Project looked at massive mobile launch platform, shuttle transporter\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - Sandia National Laboratories recently conducted a series of tests to help NASA understand the fatigue on the space shuttle caused during rollout from the Kennedy Space Center assembly building to the launch pad - a four-mile trip.\nThe tests are part of NASA's return-to-flight mission, with the first flight scheduled between May 15 and June 3.\nSandia, a National Nuclear Security Administration laboratory, helped NASA design the test and instrumentation to measure the dynamic vibration environment during rollout. Sandia also computed the input forces the crawler applies to the Mobile Launch Platform (MLP). These computations are being used by Boeing and NASA to determine the fatigue life for critical shuttle components.\nSandia engineer Tom Carne assisted in a series of tests beginning in November 2003 to develop the data necessary to understand the environment and the response of the space shuttle vehicle during rollout.\n\"NASA requested Sandia to assist them in this project because of our expertise in planning and conducting structural dynamic tests on very large structures,\" Carne says.\nSandia's solid mechanics/structural dynamics group has done numerous structural analysis projects on large structures including the I-40 Rio Grande bridge in Albuquerque, large wind turbines up to 110 meters tall, and the Department of Energy's Armored Tractor. One of the group's main missions is analysis and testing of the shock and vibration environments for weapons.\nThe three-million-pound shuttle sits on the eight-million-pound mobile launch platform, which is carried by a six-million-pound crawler. The crawler transports the vehicle and platform four miles from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad.\nMoving the shuttle that distance, which normally takes five to six hours at 0.9 mph, had been considered a relatively low-stress process during most of the life of the shuttle system. As the equipment ages, however, more emphasis is being given to understanding how the rollout may fatigue the transport system.\nData were collected for rollouts of the MLP-only and the MLP with the two solid rocket boosters, at five different speeds ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 mph. For the tests more than 100 accelerometers were placed on the MLP, crawler, and solid rocket boosters. A data acquisition system installed inside the MLP for the road test measured and recorded the accelerations. The data were analyzed so that the character of the rollout environment is understood and can be analytically imposed on the shuttle using a finite-element computer model to predict fatigue damage to critical components. Even though these stresses are much lower than those seen during the launch, the five- to six-hour duration of the transport and the low-frequency vibration could cause fatigue in components within the orbiter.\nCarne says the rollout analysis team determined that there are two families of forcing harmonics caused by the crawler drive train that vibrate the platform as a function of crawler speed, in addition to the random inputs induced by the road bed. Fortunately, he says, the harmonic forcing frequencies can be adjusted by merely changing the drive speed of the crawler, resulting in less damaging frequencies.\nThe team used a Sandia-developed algorithm, the Sum of Weighted Accelerations Technique (SWAT), to estimate the applied forces. Carne says the SWAT results were beneficial in choosing a new rollout speed that will extend the fatigue life of the shuttle components that were affected by rollout.\nThe SWAT-generated input forces have subsequently been used as the force input for NASA's NASTRAN structural analysis of the mobile launch platform, emulating the test conditions. The correlation between the rollout-measured data and the predictions from the NASTRAN analysis has engendered confidence in both the SWAT-computed forces and the NASTRAN model of the MLP and solid rocket boosters, he says.\nThe analyses showed that the shuttle's vibration response can be much reduced when the driving frequencies are shifted away from the shuttle's own resonant natural frequencies. They helped NASA determine that merely reducing crawler speed from 0.9 mph to 0.8 mph would significantly reduce the vibrations in the shuttle by shifting the impact frequency of the crawler treads.\nSource: Eurekalert & othersLast reviewed: By John M.

    "Egypt is located in the northeastern fringes of Africa and shares international boundaries with Libya to the west (692 miles), Sudan to the south (791 miles),\nThe highest elevations in Egypt are in the southern part of the country. The southern regions of the Sinai Peninsula are also mountainous. Most of Egypt is an arid desert with little or no vegetation. The Nile, the longest river in the world, flowing from the south to the north, cuts through this desert plateau and renders the county habitable. In fact, the Nile endows its delta with fertility unheard of in desert regions. With the exception of the Nile basin, the rest of the country is an arid desert with little or no vegetation. The ancient Egyptians called the Nile basin Black Land due to its rich alluvial deposits. In contrast, they referred to the desert land as Red Land.\nThe river Nile is fed by the White Nile, the Blue Nile and the Atbara rivers of central Africa. Nile enters Egypt near Wadi Halfa in Sudan.\nLake Nasser to the south of Egypt is a man-made reservoir resultant from the construction of the Aswan Dam across the Nile. The Aswan Low Dam was constructed at the First Cataract of the Nile in 1902. The High Dam was constructed between 1960 and 1970. The region extending from the Aswan Dam to the city of Cairo is referred to as the Nile Valley. The region further up north is the Nile Delta. Low-lying, flat, and rich in silt deposits, the Nile Delta's agricultural products support the entire country. The Nile is said to have had seven distributaries creating the fan-shaped valley. At present only two of these distributaries, the Damietta and the Rosetta carry the Nile waters to the Mediterranean Sea. An extensive network of canals now crisscrosses the delta region and assists the flow of the waters into the agricultural fields. A number of lakes and marshes dot the Nile Delta.\nIn early Egypt, the Nile went through cycles of inundation and relinquishment. When the Nile would flood its banks it irrigated the crops on its banks and endowed the land with great fertility. But the floods could just as easily wreak havoc on the agriculture and spell a year of economic low. The most fertile regions were those where the elevation was high or those where the primary products were tree crops. The relinquishment of the Nile spelt an enhancement of the land's fertility since the floods left behind a rich deposit of alluvial silt. The flooding of the Nile also depended largely on the amount of rainfall received by Central Africa where the tributaries of the Nile arise.\nThe construction of an irrigation system and the dams on the Nile, especially the Aswan dams, has changed a lot. The flow of the Nile no longer depends quite as heavily on the rainfall received by Central Africa. The deposit of silt is now around Lake Nasser. This has also significantly affected the fertility of the Nile basin.\nTwo major deserts make up the Egyptian desert region - the Eastern Desert and the Libyan Desert. The Eastern Desert, thus called due to its location to the east of the Nile, extends upto the Red Sea. The mountain range traversing this region is called the Eastern Desert. Shaiyb al-Banat is the highest peak of the range. To the west of the Nile is the portion of the Sahara Desert which is referred to as the Libyan Desert. The Libyan Desert is characterized by massive sand dunes and eight great depressions. The desert is mostly uninhabited except for sporadic settlements such as those in the Siwa Oasis near the Qattara Depression. The lowest point of Egypt (133 meters below sea level) is in the Qattara Depression. The Temple of Amun in the Siwa Oasis is known for its prophetic oracles. The Fayyum Oasis is another oasis in the Libyan Desert which is cultivable at certain points. Mount Catherine (2,642 meters) in the Sinai Peninsula is the highest elevation in Egypt.\nTemperatures in most of Egypt range from 80°F to 90°F in summer and from 55°F to 70°F in winter. The Mediterranean coast enjoys a cooler temperature in comparison to the rest of the country. Frequent dust storms called 'Khamaseen' blow south-north in summers. Rainfall is scanty and unpredictable. The higher elevations in the Sinai Peninsula face snowfall occasionally in winters. February-March and October-November are the tourist-friendly months in the country.",
    "Summary and Analytical Review of main themes of Douglass' Narrative\nOne of the most influential and well known abolitionists of the mid-nineteenth century, Frederick Douglass was always one to point out the evils of slavery. Being a former slave himself made his accounts of cruelty and malice all the more believable and persuading against the practice. Douglass’ Narrative is a book about his first hand experiences while he was a slave, and his early attempt to escape to freedom before he succeeded on his second attempt (the details of which are not stated in the book, so that the secret is not revealed). He focuses, expectantly, on the many cruelties and maltreatments of his masters, as well as the few kindnesses of his masters. His hopes in this book were to explain and prove the evils of slavery and the slave owners. From his writings, it is clear he has good intentions for the abolitionist movement, and he succeeds in aiding it to a great extent. His accounts of the barbarity and general cruelness of his masters (even those that were kind at first) and his mockery of the slaveholders’ religion did well to help the abolitionist movement.\nHis book begins, as do most autobiographies, with the beginning of his known and remembered life. From early on all he can remember (or at least tell us about) is the pain and suffering caused by his bondage, although in most cases, all that is known to slaves is pain and suffering. One of the first and most notable accounts he retells is the witnessing of his aunt being beaten. She was beaten and whipped for being caught in the company of a male slave with which she was forbidden to see. It was not the first time Douglass was to witness the cruelty of slavery, however. The first instance of cruelty came from the intentional separation of himself and his mother. Douglas retells of the encounters with his mother, but only to show and prove that slave owners intentionally destroyed and separated families.\nThe next, and inarguably the most important, event in his life occurred when he was moved to Baltimore to work as a house servant. In Douglass’ own Narrative he calls the event “one of the most interesting of his life” (Narrative 18). He notes that the city is much kinder to slaves than is the country plantations. In the country, he states that he “suffered little from anything than hunger and cold” (Narrative 16) while being whipped very seldom and was even favored by his master with rewards of cake. Later in the book, however, he dwells on the fierceness of slave drivers on field workers while under the care of Mr. Covey and others. Douglass says that under Covey, he was beaten and whipped to the point where he “was broken in body, soul, and spirit” (Narrative 38). In the city, at first, he was put into the best of care by his Master Hugh’s wife. At first Douglass’ mistress was “a woman of the kindest heart and finest feelings” (Narrative 19). It is arguable that she was the most influential person in Douglass’ life, for she was the one who first taught him to read, which gave him the taste of freedom. His ability to read was both hindered and helped by his master, whom upon discovery, forbade his wife from teaching Douglass to read because it was unlawful. Hugh made the mistake of alluring that the ability to read was somehow connected to freedom, which is every slave’s dream, not just Douglass’. After the discontinuing of Douglas’ formal education, his mistress became a “demon,” but he was still better treated in the city than in the country. In the city, slave owners are more social with each other, being more condensed than in the country. Because of the density of population, the slaves are seen by peers and friends of the masters and then seen as a reflection of the master; if a slave is mistreated, the master is shamed. Also after the ending of his learning from his mistress, Douglass learns to read by tricking young white boys in the city in his free time. These ‘self taught’ lessons in reading proved to be an invaluable skill to Douglass, as he more than likely used his ability to read and write to escape, as he did in his first attempt when he forged notes to escape persecution.\nAfter Douglass came of age, he was put to work as a field hand, the hardest and most detested job of any slave. Eventually he was rented to Mr. Covey, who, as mentioned before, was the cruelest master Douglass had ever worked under. While in Covey’s care, Douglass was subject to weekly (if not more often) beatings and was “seldom free from a sore back” (Narrative 36). The barbaric practices of Covey eventually caused Douglass to rise up and fight against Covey. This gave Douglass a sense of power not experienced prior. It also “rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom” in Douglass (Narrative 43). Had it not been for his fight and victory, over Covey, Douglass’ name would have been long forgotten shortly after his death in 1895, had he been able to live that long while in bondage.\nAfter Covey, Douglass was put to labor in fields belonging to a man named Freeland. There he conspired with other slaves to attempt escape, but failed. His escape attempt involved forging papers that granted him and a few others safe passage, via river boat, to Baltimore, but one of the slaves originally involved in the plan backed out, and snitched. Douglass was jailed for a week and then sent back to Baltimore, once again under the care of Hugh. While in Baltimore, Douglass learned how to become a calker for boats and was able to hire himself out under the provision that he paid his master. Douglass was responsible for his clothes, board, and job materials and tools. In a sense, Douglass was completely independent. This sense of freedom was pleasurable to Douglass, but unwanted at the same time. He thought it a great injustice to forfeit much of his earnings to a man who did nothing to earn it. Douglass eventually found the means by which to escape his forced servitude and did so.\nOne of Douglass’ main themes throughout the book is the nourishment of slaves under various owners. “Every city slave holder is anxious to have it known of him, that he feeds his slaves well” (Narrative 21). Douglas points out, often, that there is a direct connection (obviously) between the kindness of the master and the amount of food given to the slave. Douglass would often let a horse run away to a neighboring farm (5 miles away), thereby being required to fetch it, and while away, acquiring something to eat. The direct relation of food to treatment is obvious and important. It should be noted that Covey, while almost certainly cruelest of all the slave owners described, did in fact, give his slaves enough to eat, but gave them insufficient time in which to eat the meals provided.\nAnother important theme throughout Douglass’ Narrative is religion. Douglass states outright, that “for all the slaveholders that I have met, religious slaveholders are the worst. I have ever found them the meanest and basest, the most cruel and cowardly, of all others” (Narrative 46). Indeed, the cruelest master Douglas ever served under, Mr. Covey, was a “professor of religion- a pious soul- a member and class leader in the Methodist church” (Narrative 34). Two of the kindest masters Douglas labored under, Hugh and Freeland, had “no pretensions to, or professions of, religion” (Narrative 46), both of which, it should be noted, he tried (and succeeded under Hugh) to escape from. The hypocracy of religion, is seen because Douglass was fortunate enough to know how to read. Slave owners taught, out of the Bible, that servitude and obidience were key to salvation. However, when Douglass preached to other slaves (he taught many slaves to read in a sort of Sunday School he ran), he found that independance, freedom, and equality were also stressed in the Bible; two very conflicting messages that he took to hate cruel masters.\nDouglass’ own, personal experiences with the slaveholders’ brutality and the hypocrisy of their religion are good arguments for the cause of abolitionists. In the Appendix, especially, Douglass details his links between religion and the cruelness of slaveholders. He details every hypocritical aspect of America’s religions, stating “we have men-stealers for ministers, women-whippers for missionaries, and cradle-plunderers for church members” (Narrative 72). The appendix, with its religion bashing, probably did more for the abolitionist movement than his entire book did. But the violence depicted in his Narrative, as well as the intelligent arguments about religion in the appendix are a powerful and highly convincing force for the movement of which Douglass was an important part of. It cannot be determined how much aide Douglass' Narrative gave to the abolitionist movement, but the movement eventually did lead to the Fourteenth Amendment, which freed the slaves. So, in conclusion, it can be assumed that Frederick Douglass was an indisposable force to be reckoned with, and his Narritive was key to his fame and influence.",
    "Since 2002, when HAVA was enacted, computer scientists have released over three dozen studies of the software-based voting systems rushed in by HAVA. Every one of these studies has concluded that software-based optical scanners and DREs (direct record electronic systems, often known as “touch screens”) are vulnerable to undetectable manipulation and error. While any machine, including a lever voting machine, can be hacked, software enables a single individual to change thousands of votes in a few minutes without leaving a trace.\nThe inner workings of the software-based machine are invisible. Systematic exploits enable massive vote switching in minutes. In contrast, to affect the outcome of an election conducted with lever machines is labor-intensive since each machine must be individually rigged, increasing the likelihood that the crime would be caught; levers are not capable of systematic exploits. Vote flipping, common on electronic machines, is also not possible on a lever machine. Tampering to a lever machine can be detected because the working parts of the lever machine are visible, as contrasted with software, which is invisible to all but the programmers. Regardless of how the software has been programmed, self-erasing malware can be introduced into an electronic system but not into a lever system. Certification of computerized systems is a ruse because no amount of certification testing will make voting computers secure.\n- The National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Federal government’s own technical advisers, found that certification testing cannot provide security or reliability:\n[E]xperience in testing software and systems has shown that testing to high degrees of security and reliability is from a practical perspective not possible.” (Emphasis added.)\n- A 2007 report authorized by the California Secretary of State found that with software-based voting machines:\nAn attack could plausibly be accomplished by a single skilled individual with temporary access to a single voting machine. The damage could be extensive – malicious code could spread to every voting machine in polling places and to county election servers.\n- Finding error or fraud in software code has been shown to be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming due to self-erasing code and the fact that code can be several hundred thousand lines in length, according to the 2008 ACCURATE Report (A Center for Correct, Usable, Reliable, Auditable, and Transparent Elections):\n[N]o matter how hard one looks for errors or faults in voting system software, there is no way to guarantee that one has found them all. Even if no errors or faults are found, there is no way to guarantee that none exist….\n- Notwithstanding the pre-election certification of the optical scanners and even with security seals in place, in 2006 the University of Connecticut established how easily election results can be falsified on an optical scanner:\nAn Accu-Vote Optical Scan can be compromised with off-the-shelf equipment in a matter of minutes even if the machine has its removable memory card sealed in place. The basic attack can be applied to effect a variety of results, including entirely neutralizing one candidate so that their votes are not counted, swapping the votes of two candidates, or biasing the results by shifting some votes from one candidate to another….\nSuch vote tabulation corruptions can lay dormant until Election Day, thus avoiding detection through pre-election tests…. [V]oters could be unaware of any discrepancies between their cast votes and the internally recorded votes.\n- A 2007 Florida report demonstrated how viruses can be introduced and propagated from a single machine to every other computer in the jurisdiction as well as from one election to the next. Each county will use an Election Management System (EMS) computer (commonly known as a “central tabulator”). The central tabulator reprograms the optical scanners before every election using a memory card that tells the machine who is on the ballot and how to count it, and then accumulates and reports precinct-level results after an election. Florida’s study demonstrated how a virus introduced to a single machine would spread to every other machine in the county via memory cards:\nA cleverly constructed virus can cover its tracks so that infected machines could not be detected by ordinary means and an appropriately programmed virus could self-destruct and erase all its tracks…. [I]f carefully constructed, it can allow an attacker to transfer program control to her own malicious code. Once this happens, the attacker controls the machine.\n- A 2006 Princeton University report “describes how the virus propagates … via memory cards, without requiring any network.” NY’s wireless ban would not prevent this massive attack because all computers in a county communicate with the EMS central tabulator, which in turn communicates with each computer in the county:\nAn infected machine will infect any memory card that is inserted into it. An infected memory card will infect any machine that is powered up or rebooted with the memory card inserted. Because cards are transferred between machines during vote counting and administrative activities, the infected population will grow over time.\n- A 2006 report commissioned by California’s Secretary of State corroborated that these attacks to optical scanners cannot be discerned by election officials responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the election:\nThere would be no way to know that any of these attacks occurred; the canvass procedure would not detect any anomalies, and would just produce incorrect results. The only way to detect and correct the problem would be by recount of the original paper ballots.\n- A 2007 report commissioned by Florida’s Secretary of State reaffirmed that election results could be readily compromised by an individual with only brief access to an optical scanner, by replacing the memory card with one preprogrammed to read one candidate’s votes as counting for another. The report also found “The attack can be carried out with a reasonably low probability of detection….”\nFlaws in the Optical Scan software enable an unofficial memory card to be inserted into an active terminal. Such a card can be preprogrammed to swap the electronically tabulated votes for two candidates, reroute all of a candidate’s votes to a different candidate, or tabulate votes for several candidates of choice toward a different candidate.\n- In 2007, Ohio’s Secretary of State released the Evaluation and Validation of Election Related Equipment, Standards and Testing (EVEREST) study, which revealed, among other things, the ineffectiveness of requirements –such as NY’s — that the source code be escrowed to secure the software. The EVEREST team was able to penetrate all of Ohio’s voting systems, including Sequoia’s optical scanner, without the source code. None of these attacks could have been detected or prevented by knowing the source code. The EVEREST report concluded that software-based systems are “insufficient to guarantee a trustworthy election.”",

    "Strategic Environmental Assessment\nStrategic environmental assessment (SEA) is a tool that contributes to informed decisions in support of sustainable development by incorporating environmental considerations into the development of public policies and strategic decisions.\nThe Cabinet Directive\nThe Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals sets out the expectations of ministers and Cabinet on when a SEA should be conducted and what it should consider. It requires that the environmental analysis be fully integrated into the proposal development process. It specifies that ministers expect a SEA when the following two conditions are met:\n- The proposal is submitted to an individual minister or Cabinet for approval.\n- The implementation of the proposal may result in important environmental effects, either positive or negative.\nThe Guidelines for the Implementation of the Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals (the Guidelines) describe the overall process and guiding principles for SEA.

    "Optimism bias: Why the young and the old tend to look on the bright side\nEven more surprising was the finding that kids and elderly people both showed more of a bias than college students. On one hand, the young and the old were quite good at responding to desirable information: Everyone updated their beliefs similarly when they learned they were less likely to get cancer or have their credit card stolen than they had initially believed. But when they learned their chances were worse than expected, kids, teenagers and older adults seemed to ignore this information more than college students and middle-aged individuals.\nThe behavioral economist Andrew Oswald has found that from about the time we are teenagers, our sense of happiness starts to decline, hitting rock bottom in our mid-40s. (Middle-age crisis, anyone?) Then our sense of happiness miraculously starts to go up again rapidly as we grow older. This finding contradicts the common assumption that people in their 60s, 70s and 80s are less happy and satisfied than people in their 30s and 40s.\nHow can we explain this? The first thing that comes to mind is that these changes have something to do with raising kids in our 30s and 40s. Could it be that having children in the household has a negative influence on our happiness?\nOswald ruled out this possibility. He also controlled for people being born in better times, marital status, education, employment status, income: The age pattern persisted. Even more surprising, the pattern held strong even though Oswald did not control for physical health. In other words, older individuals are happier and more satisfied than middle-aged individuals even though the health of the former is generally worse.\nOswald tested half a million people in 72 countries, in both developing and developed nations. He observed the same pattern across all parts of the globe and across sexes. Happiness diminishes as we transition from childhood to adulthood and then starts rising as we grow wrinkles and acquire gray hair.\nAnd it’s not only we humans who slump in the middle and feel sunnier toward the end. Just recently, Oswald and colleagues demonstrated that even chimpanzees and orangutans appear to experience a similar pattern of midlife malaise.",
    "Growing Political Turmoil\nAfter the conservatives came to power in Spain in November 1933, the CNT planned a national uprising for December 8. Despite a spectacular Barcelona jail break by CNT prisoners, the insurrection was a failure; indeed, it was used to legitimate government censorship, union repression, and the arrest of labor leaders. When, in October 1934, the Catholic conservative party won three cabinet positions, Socialists and anarcho-syndicalists were galvanized to take action against what they feared would be a right-wing coup, whether in fact or\nin name. Within a few days, the CNT and the Socialist General Confederation of Workers (UGT), which since December 1933 had been discussing some kind of working-class alliance, planned a national general strike. It began on October 4, with coal miners in Asturias in northern Spain leading the struggle. If there had been any doubts about the ruthlessness of the new republican government, they were laid to rest by its treatment of the workers. Utterly unsympathetic to the gruesome conditions under which the coal miners worked and without concern for their fears, it called in Colonel Francisco Franco. As commander of the crack Moroccan troops and Foreign Legion mercenaries, Franco showed no mercy as his soldiers quashed the miners and their supporters. From October 10 to October 18, Moroccan troops and Legionnaires were permitted to rape and pillage in the mining towns of Asturias. The maneuver resulted in about one thousand dead and thirty to forty thousand jailed throughout Spain.\nThe day after the nationwide general strike was called on October 4, 1934, Lluís Companys, now president of the Generalitat, proclaimed the \"Republic of Catalunya within the Federal Republic of Spain\"—an act that was regarded as treason, since there was no federalist state at the time. Companys was arrested and held for sixteen months, and the Statute of Autonomy was abrogated.\nAfter the strike, forces from among Spain's landowners, its army, and its fascist Falange political party had begun to negotiate with Mussolini and Hitler, from whom they obtained financial commitments and promises of military support for a rebellion to overthrow the legally elected Second Republic. The republicans and the left, increasingly aware of the growing fascist menace throughout Europe and mindful that in 1933 divisions among republicans, Socialists, and leftists had permitted conservatives to come to power in Spain, decided to run a unified slate for the parliamentary elections of February 16, 1936. Their coalition, like other such slates elsewhere in Europe, was known as the Popular Front.\nMeanwhile, during the summer of 1935, Jaume Sabartés, a poet turned journalist who had been a close friend of Picasso's some three decades earlier in Barcelona, received a summons from the painter. Now that Picasso had left his wife Olga Koklova, with whom he had been fighting for years, he needed a secretary. He hoped that Sabartés, who had recently returned to the city after twenty years as a journalist in Latin America, would accept this position. Although Sabartés had been\nthe butt of Picasso's jokes in their youth, he was happy to serve. Persuading his own wife to join him, Sabartés headed for Paris, where, from November 1935 to the winter of 1937, he practically lived with Picasso as his secretary and companion. Presumably, he filled Picasso in on recent events in Barcelona.\nIn the midst of the Popular Front election campaign, Picasso was contacted by the Catalan Friends of the New Arts (Amics de l'Art Nou, or ADLAN), who wanted to open an exhibit of his work on February 18, 1936, two days after the election was scheduled to take place. Even though Picasso was a celebrity, few in Barcelona were familiar with his art, which had not been seen since he and Ramón Casas exhibited jointly in Barcelona in 1932. Picasso agreed to the retrospective but refused to attend. His mother, María Picasso, Joan Miró, and Salvador Dalí talked on the radio in his place to publicize the show. Picasso's friend, the surrealist poet Paul Éluard, traveled down to Barcelona from Paris for the exhibit and delivered a lecture at the opening. Éluard, standing in for Picasso, received the hearty support of students who chanted, \"Picasso, the Marxist,\" confirming that they saw Picasso as a radical. (In fact, although Picasso did later, in 1944, join the Communist party of France, Éluard, like most of the other surrealists, had become a member in 1926.)\nWhen the Popular Front won the elections in February, the left was jubilant, and the right intensified their plotting. With the support of Catholic landowners and fascists, five generals, including Francisco Franco, organized a barracks uprising for July 18, 1936, that was designed to overthrow the freely elected government and impose one more congenial to themselves. The plotters, however, had not counted on the loyalty of certain officers who supported the Popular Front. Nor did they count on the quick action of the people in cities like Barcelona, Madrid, and Seville, where civilians—many of them acting through their unions—rose up to defend the Republic. Only about half of Spain went over to the rebels. And thus the Spanish Civil War of 1936 to 1939 began.\nOn the day of the attempted coup in Barcelona, the CNT marched on the army barracks, disarmed the soldiers, and seized their weapons to arm themselves. Having chafed at the bit under nearly five years of republican rule, the CNT now attempted to carry out a social revolution by collectivizing all local economic and social resources. George Orwell, who was in Barcelona shortly afterward, talked about how it felt to be in a city in which the people ruled:\nIt was the first time I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or with the red and black flag of the Anarchists;... almost every church had been gutted and its images burnt. Every shop and café had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized; even the bootblacks had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-workers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal. Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said \"Señor\" or \"Don\" or even \"Usted\"; everyone called everyone else \"Comrade\" and \"Thou. \"... The revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining advertisements look like daubs of mud.... Practically everyone wore rough working-class clothes, or blue overalls, or some variant of the militia uniform. All this was queer and moving. There was much in it that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for.\nThe Spanish Republican government continued to carry on its work while it attempted to defend itself against its enemies. The right-wing rebels, among whom General Francisco Franco had become preeminent by November 1936, were willing to empower Hitler and Mussolini to test new military strategies on Spain in their behalf. On October 23, 1936, three months after the Civil War had begun, the Luftwaffe began to bomb Madrid. Over five thousand people were killed in a single night, in the first time systematic bombing was used specifically to terrorize and crush the will of a civilian population. Like later similar attempts, however, this first instance only enhanced the resolve of the people, both in Madrid and in the Spanish nation as a whole. It was at this time that Dolores Ibarruri, a Communist leader known as \"La Pasionaria,\" coined the slogan \"No pasarán\" (They shall not pass), which became a watchword for democratic forces throughout the world.",
    "A new atlas and catalog of the entire infrared sky with more than a half-billion stars, galaxies and other objects captured by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission was unveiled by NASA Wednesday.\n\"Today WISE delivers the fruit of 14 years of effort to the astronomical community,\" said Edward L. (Ned) Wright, a UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the mission's principal investigator, who began working on the mission in 1998.\nA 10-foot unmanned satellite weighing 1,400 pounds, WISE was launched into space on Dec. 14, 2009, and mapped the sky in 2010. Like a powerful set of night-vision goggles, WISE surveyed the cosmos with infrared detectors about 300 times more sensitive than those used in previous survey missions, said Wright, who holds UCLA's David Saxon Presidential Chair in Physics. WISE collected 15 trillion bytes of data and more than 2.7 million images taken at four infrared wavelengths of light — invisible to the unaided human eye — capturing everything from nearby asteroids to distant galaxies.\nThe individual WISE exposures have been combined into an atlas of more than 18,000 images and a catalog listing the infrared properties of more than 560 million objects found in the images. Most of the objects are stars and galaxies, with roughly equal numbers of each; many of them have never been seen before.\nWISE observations have already led to many discoveries, including elusive failed stars, or Y-dwarfs. Astronomers had been hunting for Y-dwarfs for more than a decade. Because they have been cooling since their formation, they do not shine in visible light and could not be spotted until WISE mapped the sky with its infrared vision. WISE has also found that there are significantly fewer mid-size near-Earth asteroids than astronomers had previously feared. With this data, now more than 90 percent of the largest of the asteroids have been identified.\nOne image released today (see the online version of this news release) shows a surprising view of an \"echo\" of infrared light surrounding an exploded star. The echo was etched in the clouds when a flash of light from the supernova explosion heated surrounding clouds.

    "There are many reasons for man to be grateful for fire. The two biggest are that is provides us with a source for cooking and heat.\nVia the source of gas, fire still continues to provide us with heat and a source of cooking. The fire is under much greater control than it was when Neanderthals discovered fire tens of thousands of years ago.\nFire is something us to be grateful for in many ways, but it can also be a scary thing that causes tremendous damage each year. We can still have a sense of gratefulness towards those that work to fight fires.\nAs technology advances the fight against putting unwanted fires out seems to continue to get better. Accidental fires can happen for many reasons. Some happen through nature from lightning and other sources, while others occur from man-made sources or arson.\nMost of us take much of what we have in our daily lives for granted. Having fire is something that we don’t usually think about consciously think about. It’s always prevalent in our lives. We use fire to heat our homes and with a gas stove cook our food.\nWhen we roll our garbage cans out to the curb once or twice per week do we think about how the garbage is disposed of? It’s picked up by a garbage truck and eventually brought to a landfill where the waste is slowly burned off.\nFire can also be used in many other ways. Other sources can be to provide light, energy, blacksmithing and glass making all require fire. Without fire, most of the things we take for granted would come to a halt.\nAlthough most of us don’t use it directly, on a daily basis Fire provides us with most of the things we now consider necessities to live, thrive and survive.",
    "A species on the brink – Freshwater Pearl Mussel\nThey can live for over a century, they have one of the most bizarre life-cycles of any species you’re likely to find and they’re one of the reasons why the Romans invaded Britain. What’s more is that their future is in our hands. The freshwater pearl mussel might not have the glamour of some other iconic ‘Scottish’ species like the golden eagle or red squirrel, but they’re incredibly important. Scotland holds around half of the world’s population of this fascinating creature and they are currently balancing on a knife-edge.\nPopulations are found in some of the rivers flowing into Loch Ness.\nFreshwater pearl mussels are very slow-growing and live at the bottom of clean, generally fast-flowing rivers. These animals, which spend the early part of their life harmlessly attached to the gills of trout and salmon before settling onto a suitable substrate are now extinct across most of their former range. Highland rivers are a stronghold for the species.\nAs their name suggests, they very occasionally bear a pearl, and this has in many ways led to their downfall. The taking of mussels by ‘pearl-fishers’ has been the main reason for the massive declines in these populations, but they have also been affected by pollution and river-engineering works.\nThe freshwater pearl mussel was given full legal protection in 1998 but unfortunately illegal activity still continues. Every year we still come across significant ‘kills’ where piles of hundreds of empty shells mark the scene of a few hours illegal fishing, where a whole population of this globally threatened species can be wiped out in a couple of hours.\nThese threats to the species have meant that the freshwater pearl mussel is a UK Wildlife Crime priority. This means that the Police work closely with Scottish Natural Heritage, anglers, bailiffs, river users and a wide-range of other organisations to help tackle these crimes by improving awareness, collection of intelligence and better enforcement to safeguard the species.\nHowever, whilst the police and other organisations do their best to help tackle wildlife crime in this way they can’t do it alone, and the help of the public can be absolutely crucial. Pearl fishing is often carried out in remote locations, or very early in the morning when there is less chance of being detected, and often during the summer when daylight hours are long and the rivers are low. Fishing is often carried out by wading out into rivers and using glass-bottomed buckets to find the mussels and a cleft stick to recover them. If anyone sees or suspects that pearl fishing is taking place we urge people to report it to their local police station and Wildlife Crime Officer as soon as possible.\nAt the same time there are numerous projects aimed at active conservation of the species, including a recent £3.5 million project funded by the European Commission’s LIFE+ fund and secured by Scottish National Heritage and 14 other organisations. The project will improve habitats for the species, encourage simple and effective positive management of rivers where they are present, improve awareness and understanding of the species as well as helping address wildlife crime issues.\nSo it’s not all doom and gloom for this remarkable species, and everybody has a role in ensuring it’s survival – let’s hope that we can bring the freshwater pearl mussel back from the brink.\nIf you would like more information on the species visit SNH’s website at http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/species/invertebrates/freshwater-invertebrates/freshwater-pearl-mussel/",
    "A couple of months or so ago, I began talking about SQL functions and what they're used for. This article picks up where I left off. It defines the two types of functions, and begins to explain them in great detail.\nPoor Arnold; in addition to being vertically challenged, he was also beset with frequent ear infections, and never knew what his brother Willis was talking about. Fortunately for him, Mr. Drummond was looted up, and all Arnold really needed to understand was that money talks. And when Arnold wanted to count the oodles of money he would have once old man Drummond kicked the bucket, well...he could have used Aggregate functions to help with that.\nAn aggregate function helps summarize large volumes (or even small ones, really) of data. If you have a collection of phone numbers you've collected and want to know how many you have (let's face it, you're a programmer, so you don't) or you want to get a count on the number of days you've spent alone and eating a giant bag of Doritos, you could do just that.\n(Just as a side note: the word \"Doritos\" is actually in the built-in spell check of Microsoft Word).\nBelow is a list of some aggregate functions and what they can do:\nWhat it Does\nGives you the average value of the column\nCounts the number of rows with data in a column\nCounts the number of selected rows\nGives the value of the first record in a specified field\nGives the value of the last record in a specified field\nGives the maximum value in a column\nGives the minimum value in a column\nSums up the value of a column\nI don't have to tell you what average means; you've been that way your entire life. I mean come on, you're no James Marsden. And if you are, please don't sue me for using your name.\nThe average function in SQL returns the average value of a given column. Let's say we have a table that lists a person's name, age, and salary and we want to see the average age of the employees listed in the database. Want to follow along? Okay, go ahead and create a table named Employees with the data below:\nKing Kong Wong\nClearly this company has an age discrimination suit waiting to happen. But never mind that for now. I think our table lists a realistic situation, don't you? Coincidentally, all names are fictitious, and any resemblance to real names is purely coincidental.\nHere's the code for the average age:\nSelect AVG(Age) from Employees\nThis would result in the answer: 45.75.\nNow let's say you are gearing up for that age discrimination lawsuit and need some more data to back you up. Let's say you want to see the average salary of anyone over 30 years old:\nSelect AVG(Salary) From Employees WHERE Age>30\nYour answer would be $31,000. You might also wish to see the average salary of those under thirty. To do that, simply reverse the criteria:\nSelect AVG(Salary) From Employees WHERE Age<30\nWhich results in: $90,000. A clear case for age discrimination.",
    "General Definitions of Types of Dog Collars\ncollar with traditional buckle. A collar is a piece of material put around the neck\nof a dog for control, identification, or other purposes. Identification tags and\nmedical information is often placed on collars. Collars are also useful for controlling\nthe dog, as they provide a handle for grabbing.\nBuckle collars, also called flat collars, are usually\nnylon or leather with a buckle similar to a belt buckle or a quick-release buckle,\neither of which holds the collar loosely around the dog's neck. Usually identification\nis attached to such a collar; it also comes with a loop to which a leash can be\nNylon quick-release buckle collar with identification\nand medical tags. Flea collars are impregnated with chemicals that repel fleas.\nThey are usually a supplementary collar, worn in addition to the conventional buckle\ncollar. An Elizabethan collar, shaped like a truncated cone, is worn by a pet, usually\na cat or dog, to prevent it scratching a wound on its head or neck or licking a\nwound or infection on its body.\nSeveral types of collars are used for dog training:\nFlat collars: Many dogs are trained on leash using a\nbuckle or quick-release collar.\nshowing how the chain pulls through the loop at one end. Slip chain (also called\nchoke chain, slip collar, or choke collar) is a length of chain or nylon rope with\nrings at either end such that the collar can be formed into a loop around the animal's\nneck that slips (adjusts) tighter when pulled and slips looser when tension is released.\nUsed for training if the dog is not responsive on a buckle collar; provides some\nadditional control and prevents a wild dog from being able to thrash its way out\nof a looser collar. It can also, when pulled hard enough, tighten around the neck\nin a way that prevents airflow. When not used properly, the slip collar will actually\ncause a dog to pull, rather than inhibit it from doing so. Properly used, the slip\ncollar is quickly popped and released as a firm reminder to the dog to pay attention;\nit is not pulled tight and held.\nthe looped chain limits how tightly the collar can pull in the same way that a Martingale\nfunctions. Prong collar (also called pinch collar) is a series of chain links with\nopen ends turned towards the dog's neck so that, when the collar is tightened, it\npinches the naturally loose skin around the dog's neck. When properly adjusted and\nused, it startles the dog and gives a sharp correction, but it is very difficult\nif not impossible to actually puncture the skin. And while it looks painful, it's\nactually less harmful to the dog than a slip or choke collar. Opponents argue that\npain is never a good default way in which to train animals. Some dogs are nearly\noblivious to leash corrections of any kind, including the prong collar, but the\nprong collar might make such dogs pay more attention than other collar types. The\nadvantage of the prong collar over the choke collar is that the circumference is\nlimited so that it is impossible to compress the animal's throat. Another advantage\nis that, like with the Martingale collar (below), any pressure on the dog's neck\nis spread out over a larger area than with most buckle collars, and with all choke\nMartingale collars have a longer section usually made\nof leather, chain, or nylon, joined through loops by a circle of chain or leather\nto which the leash is fastened; pulling on the leash tightens the collar, but the\nwide section both prevents the chain from tangling in a dog's coat and prevents\nthe collar from being pulled tightly enough to cut off the dog's airway. It also\nspreads pressure on the dog's neck over a larger area.\nStud collar is fitted with sharp points and metal studs\nthat prevent another animal from biting the neck. While such a collar may appear\nbrutal, it is actually the best collar for a milder mannered or older animal interacting\nwith its more aggressive fellows.\ncollar controls the dog's head but does not restrict its ability to pant, drink,\nor grasp objects.Halter collar, such as those sold under the brand names Haltie\nor Gentle Leader; like a halter on a horse, this collar fastens around the back\nof the neck and over the top of the muzzle, giving more control over a dog's direction\nand the intensity of pulling on a leash than collars that fit strictly around the\nneck. Pressure on this type of collar pulls the dog's head towards the handler.\nProponents of the head halter describe it as \"scientific\", in that it supposedly\nmimics the way higher-ranking wolf shows dominance by grabbing a lower-ranking pack\nmember around the snout with his jaws. Opponents cite new research on wild wolves,\nwhich indicates that there is no hierarchical structure in a wild wolf pack, meaning\nthat there are no \"ranks\" among pack members. This research also shows that dominance\ndisplays are uncommon, and that no wild wolf has ever been observed displaying snout-grabbing\nbehavior as a means of discipline, let alone teaching the other wolf to walk on\na leash. Opponents of the head halter also cite the fact that most dogs find it\nunnatural and uncomfortable. And though it's uncommon, some dogs have even had their\nsnouts injured by a halter that dug too deeply into their skin.",
    "In 1942, a United Press International photographer visited a metal pressing factory outside Detroit and took a snapshot of a slim, fresh-faced brunette leaning over a machine. The picture enchanted the graphic artist J. Howard Miller, who had been hired by the Westinghouse Company to design a series of motivational posters aimed at boosting female factory workers’ morale. He incorporated its pretty young subject’s face and polka-dot headscarf into one of the posters, which features a determined-looking woman flexing her right bicep under the slogan “We Can Do It!” Decades later, the poster became one of America’s most recognizable emblems of women’s empowerment, spawning countless imitations and reproduced on everything from mugs and magnets to postage stamps.\nGeraldine Hoff Doyle, the real-life inspiration behind the iconic poster, died on December 26 in Lansing, Michigan, at the age of 86. Just 17 when the photographer captured her, she had taken a factory job after graduating high school, one of 6 million women who entered the workforce during World War II to plug gaping holes in the industrial labor force. An aspiring cellist, Doyle left after just two weeks of employment when she learned that the machinery had badly injured another worker’s hands. She found a position at a soda fountain and bookstore, where she met her future husband, Leo, in 1943. The couple had six children and ran a successful dental practice.\nMore than four decades would go by before Doyle learned of the poster’s existence and discovered that her likeness had inspired a pop culture reference. Paging through a magazine one day in 1984, she spotted a photograph of the poster and recognized her younger self. In a 2002 interview with the Lansing State Journal, Doyle, who began making frequent appearances in Michigan to sign posters, explained that motherhood and daily life had kept her too busy to realize she had become the face of Rosie the Riveter. “I was changing diapers all the time,” she said.\nUnlike another famous depiction, painted by Norman Rockwell and featured on a Saturday Evening Post cover in 1943, the “We Can Do It!” poster was not originally intended as a portrayal of Rosie the Riveter, who was first immortalized in a 1942 hit song and starred in numerous government-sponsored recruitment campaigns. One of many in Miller’s series, the poster was barely seen outside Westinghouse factories in the Midwest, where women were making plastic helmet liners. It was not until later, when feminists rediscovered the poster during the 1970s and 1980s, that it achieved its iconic status and became associated with the World War II-era character.",
    "Women’s rights, the unfinished struggleWritten by Admin\nTo the Editor:\nThroughout America’s history courageous women have struggled to achieve social and political freedom and equality. They have fought against laws and cultural and religious traditions assigning them subservient roles in American society. This long struggle has produced many heroines.\nColonial American Anne Hutchinson defied laws forbidding women to speak publicly and interpret the word of God. Forbidden the right to defend herself, she was tried and convicted of heresy, and banished from Massachusetts Colony. Elizabeth Cady Stanton organized the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, over her frustration regarding the inferior role of women in America. This meeting, attended by 68 women and 32 men, marks the birth of the women’s rights movement.\nIn 19th century America, women were not allowed to inherit property, sue for divorce or retain custody of their children. Brave women who spoke publicly against cultural and legal restrictions on their freedom were persecuted and labeled unfeminine. Gradually, their cause gained support from mothers, wives, sisters and daughters. Women exerted pressure on male lawmakers and by the end of the century these legal restrictions were eliminated.\nAnother heroine, Susan B. Anthony, began working for women’s rights in mid-1800. Her struggle to gain the vote for women continued until her death in 1906. The 70-year-long crusade for women’s suffrage became a reality with the passage of the 19th Amendment. No political party can take credit for this victory. It came about because dedicated women worked tirelessly, putting pressure on male legislators and vigorously campaigning against elected officials who opposed women’s right to vote.\nWomen have struggled for centuries for equality in the workplace. The Lilly Ledbetter Act was passed in 2009, guaranteeing women equal pay for equal work. Responding to corporate lobbyists, Congress later rejected legislation requiring disclosure of workers’ pay by business owners. Inequality continues when women can’t know if their pay equals that of their male counterparts.\nToday women are fighting for the right to control decisions regarding their own bodies. Male-dominated legislators pass laws restricting women’s right to choose. Lingering cultural and religious attitudes view women as being emotionally and intellectually inferior, not to be trusted with their own reproductive decisions. Introduction of the “pill” freed women to make choices about family planning. Middle and upper class women can afford good medical care. Many poor and often single women cannot afford this. Planned Parenthood fills this need providing many services including reproductive counseling and cancer screening.\nMost women and men understand women are capable of making responsible choices regarding their bodies without government intervention. Some current legislators, including Sen. Jim Davis, R-Franklin, hold contradictory attitudes about a woman’s right to affordable health care. They argue poor women shouldn’t have children while opposing funding for Planned Parenthood providing women access to responsible health care. Concerned voters must examine the position on women’s rights of candidates running for elective office. Today’s women owe a great debt to the courageous heroines from our past. We must carry their torch to the finish line.",

    "Today, sports eyewear can be spotted on almost anyone who picks up a ball, bat, racquet or stick — whether they play in the major leagues or the Little League. Fortunately, coaches, parents and players now realize that wearing protective eyewear for sports pays off in several ways. The risk of eye damage is reduced or eliminated, and the player's performance is enhanced by the fact that they see well. In fact, many clubs today do not permit their members to participate without wearing proper eye gear.\nInitially, there was some resistance by children to \"looking funny\" when they wore protective eyewear. Today, sports goggles are an accepted part of everyday life, much the way bike helmets have become the norm. In addition, both children and adults like the image that wearing protective eyewear gives them: it shows they mean business on the playing field.\nIf you're not wearing protective eyewear, consider this...\nPrevent Blindness America reports that hospital emergency rooms treat 40,000 eye injuries every year that are sports-related. Sports such as racquetball, tennis and badminton may seem relatively harmless, but they involve objects moving at 60 miles per hour or faster. During a typical game, a racquetball can travel between 60 and 200 miles per hour. Another potential danger is that the racquets themselves move at high speed in a confined space and often make contact with one another.\nFlying objects aren't the only hazard. Many eye injuries come from pokes and jabs by fingers and elbows, particularly in games where players are in close contact with each other. Basketball, for example, has an extremely high rate of eye injury.\nThese are great reasons to wear protective eyewear. Another aspect has to do with performance. It used to be common for people with mild to moderate prescriptions to simply participate in sports without wearing their glasses or contacts. But sharp vision is a vital ingredient to performing well in nearly every sport, and participating in sports when you have less than 20/20 vision is counterproductive.\nFeatures to look for\nPrescription glasses, sunglasses and even on-the-job industrial safety glasses don’t provide adequate protection for sports use. Sports goggles are made in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some are even designed to fit in helmets used for football, hockey and baseball. Sports goggles should allow the use of helmets when the sport calls for it.\nLenses in sports eyewear are usually made of polycarbonate. Since polycarbonate is such an impact-resistant lens material, it works well to protect eyes from fast-moving objects. Polycarbonate lenses also have built-in ultraviolet (UV) protection and are coated to be scratch resistant — valuable properties for outdoor sports.\nPolycarbonate is the material of choice for sports lenses, but the eyewear frame plays just as important a role. Different sports require different types of frames, which has led to development of sport-specific frames. Sport frames are constructed of highly impact-resistant plastic or polycarbonate, and most come with rubber padding to cushion the frame where it comes in contact with your head and the bridge of your nose.\nSome sports styles are contoured, wrapping slightly around the face. This type of goggle works well for biking, hang-gliding, and sailing. Contact lens wearers especially benefit from the wraparound style, which shields your eyes from wind and dust.\nA note about handball goggles\nAt one time, handball goggles for those with no need for vision correction were simply goggles with small openings in place of lenses. It was eventually recognized that the high speed of handballs compressed the ball enough to protrude through the opening and cause serious eye damage. All goggles worn for handball and racquetball should include impact-resistant polycarbonate lenses for adequate protection during these sports.\nSport goggles must be properly fit to the individual wearer. This is particularly important with children, because there is a temptation to purchase a larger goggle than what is needed today so the youngster has \"room to grow.\" Some growing room is acceptable, since sports goggles are made to be somewhat flexible in their width adjustment. If the frames are oversize, however, they will not protect the way they were designed, leaving a potential for damage when there is impact to the head or the face. It's a risk not worth taking.\nBy the same token, permitting a youngster to continue wearing goggles that he or she has outgrown can be just as dangerous. First, the frames will be uncomfortable, tempting the child to take them off. Secondly, the frames may obstruct peripheral vision, leading to poor performance with a potential for impact from unseen sources to one side or another. Review the fit of your youngsters' sports eyewear each year to ensure that they are still providing proper protection and are fitting comfortably. Make sure the padding inside the sides of the goggle rests flush with the face and the eyes are centered in the lens area.\nFor more information on sports eyewear, visit All About Vision®.\nArticle ©2008 Access Media Group LLC.

    "For many people, learning a language involves going to classes, doing homework, taking tests and trying to memorise vocabulary. Others try to teach themselves languages using similar techniques. These are all useful things to do, but won’t necessarily give you a fluency in the language. Conscious learning of a language using these methods tends to feel like hard work.\nIf you really want to become highly proficient in a language, you need to spend a lot of time immersed in it. To become good at speaking the language, for example, you need to find opportunities to use it with other people, ideally in situations where you have to use it, or at least try to say as much as you can without falling back on your native language. Listening to radio programmes, watching videos, films and TV programmes, reading books and other material, and writing it as often as you can are also good things to do. This may not feel like study, especially if they involves subjects and activities you really enjoy, but you will be absorbing and acquiring a lot of the language without realizing it.\nConscious learning and sub-conscious acquisition are both good ways to learn languages.

    "The elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen lie at the heart of the biological processes that make life possible, but they are by no means the only elements that facilitate those processes.\nTwo scientific papers, published in the journal Science, refuted the 2010 NASA finding that bacterium called GFAJ-1 not only tolerates arsenic, but actually incorporates the poison into its DNA, swapping out phosphorus. The finding, at the time, was hailed as a significant new discovery, which could increase the likelihood of discovering exotic life on other planets.\n“Contrary to an original report, the new research clearly shows that the bacterium, GFAJ-1, cannot substitute arsenic for phosphorus to survive,” the journal said. ”If true, such a finding would have important implications for our understanding of life’s basic requirements since all known forms of life on Earth use six elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur.”\nPhosphorous may not be one of the first elements that comes to mind when it comes to supporting life, but there are good reasons that phosphates are a critical component in plant fertilizers. Both DNA and RNA are dependent on the availablility of phosphorous, as are energy storage compounds such as ATP, and thus, the presence of biologically available (i.e., able to be metabolized by an organism) phosphorous is seen as an essential environmental requirement.\nA 2010 NASA study garnered a lot of attention when its authors, observing bacteria in Lake Mono, California, reported that the bacteria were surviving on arsenic instead of phosphorous. Such a discovery would be of obvious interest to NASA, as it would expand the list of possible environments where life might be found beyond the confines of Earth. This bacteria, dubbed GFAJ-1, reportedly utilized arsenic in the construction of its cell wall as well as other systems.\n“The newly discovered microbe, strain GFAJ-1, is a member of a common group of bacteria, the Gammaproteobacteria. In the laboratory, the researchers successfully grew microbes from the lake on a diet that was very lean on phosphorus, but included generous helpings of arsenic. When researchers removed the phosphorus and replaced it with arsenic the microbes continued to grow. Subsequent analyses indicated that the arsenic was being used to produce the building blocks of new GFAJ-1 cells,” the report noted at the time.\nOne independent team is disputing the finding, arguing that the bacteria are simply well-adapted to life in the extreme lake environment and able to efficiently use the scarce amount of phosphorous to meet its needs. The team notes that arsenic does not contribute to the growth of the microbe at all.\nMeanwhile, another group led by Tobias Erb from the Institute of Microbiology at ETH Zurich targeted the claim that GFAJ-1 did not rely on the phosphorus present in the samples. While the original group insisted that the levels of phosphorus were simply too low to accommodate life, the new report found that the organism was incapable of surviving without some amount of the substance.\nThe lead researcher from the NASA study, Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiology Institute, defended the study, saying that the data in the new findings do not, in fact, conflict with the study at all.\n“We are working to define where the arsenate is [in the organism], rather than where it is not,” she said. ”How does GFAJ-1 thrive in such high levels of arsenic? Where is the arsenic going? This is our continued focus.”\nIn addition, Michael H. New, astrobiology discipline scientist at NASA Headquarters’ Planetary Science Division, said in a statement that the U.S. space agency supports an open dialogue on the matter:\n“NASA supports robust and continuous peer review of any scientific finding, especially discoveries with wide-ranging implications. It was expected that the 2010 Wolfe-Simon et al. Science paper would not be exempt from such standard scientific practices, and in fact, was anticipated to generate significant scientific attention given the surprising results in that paper. The two new papers published in Science on the microorganism GFAJ-1 exemplify this process and provide important new insights. Though these new papers challenge some of the conclusions of the original paper, neither paper invalidates the 2010 observations of a remarkable microorganism that can survive in a highly phosphate-poor and arsenic-rich environment toxic to many other microorganisms. What has emerged from these three papers is an as yet incomplete picture of GFAJ-1 that clearly calls for additional research.”\nSkepticism over the validity of the findings is likely to leave alien hunters a bit disheartened. The 2010 study was the result of a test proposed by astrobiologist Paul Davies, director of the BEYOND Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science at Arizona State University, Tempe. Mr. Davies encouraged scientists to scour the Earth for organisms so exotic that they must have derived from other planets.\nThe findings were released Sunday in the journal Science.",
    "What are the Roles of Largest Groups of Mammals\nMammals are air-breathing vertebrate animals that came, from the mammary glands that are functions in mothers with young. The word “mammal” is from the scientific name Mammalia derived from the Latin word mamma. There are about 5,000 species of living mammals. Unlike other class of animals, mammals have hairs in the body, have 3 middle ear bones, and they nourish their young with milk. All female mammals nurse their young born with their own milk, who lay from its sweet glands called the mammary glands. They feed their young born and stay with them until they develop well. They protect their young even if, it can cause their life. The largest Groups of Mammals are the placental group. Placental is a class of mammal who carry their young inside their body. This include the whales, dogs, cats, rats, deer, sheep’s, bears, seals, rabbits and even us the human species can be called as mammals.\nThere are other mammals that they call the marsupial. This class of mammal carried and nourishes the young’s in a pouch like the kangaroo and monkey. They protect them and teach them until the time to come that they are grown and ready to get out of the pouch. Only that human species are the highest group of mammals that live on earth. Most of the mammals possess specialized teeth. Human species are a bit different from the other mammals because they have the higher class of brain. There thinking ability is not like other animals. Not all animals can be part of the group of mammals. Only those animals that have a strong connection with their young can be class as mammals. Reptiles and birds are sometimes referred as a mammal like, but they are not mammals. In short that animal who lays egg is not a mammal.",
    "July 24, 2007 An eight-month voyage through the Arctic Ocean, without ship or travel route: the North Pole drifting station NP-35 represents an unusual project of the International Polar Year.\nAt the end of August the expedition, under Russian leadership, will leave for the Arctic Ocean. One of the participants is Jürgen Graeser of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, one of the research centres of the Helmholtz Association. For the first time in the history of Russian research using drifting stations, a German researcher will take part in the North Pole drifting station NP-35. With his data recordings of the atmosphere, Graeser will supplement measurements carried out by the Russian project partners, who will be focusing their investigations on sea ice, primarily performing measurements close to the ice.\nThrough this collaboration, the project partners intend to advance the currently patchy data situation in the Arctic and hope to gain a better understanding of these key regions for global climate change.\nThe planned project will be carried out in conjunction with the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) in St Petersburg. On August 29, 2007, a total of 36 expedition participants will board the Russian research vessel 'Akademik Fedorov' in the Siberian harbour of Tiksi. In the vicinity of Wrangel Island, i.e. between 80 and 85 degrees northern latitude and between 170 degrees eastern and 170 degrees western longitude, a stable ice floe will be chosen as the base for the drifting station 'North Pole 35' (NP-35). The selection will be based on long-term satellite observations of the ice and will be verified by helicopter from the research vessel. During the course of winter, the ice floe will drift in the Arctic Ocean and across the North Pole.\nDuring the drift, a variety of measurements carried out at the station will provide information about current climate change. The 'Akademik Fedorov' is scheduled to evacuate the station after approximately one year. With regard to over-wintering personnel, it is planned to use 'Polar 5', the research aircraft of the Alfred Wegener Institute, to fly out Jürgen Graeser and five Russian colleagues after approximately eight months, in April 2008. For this purpose, a landing strip will be constructed on the ice.\nThe research programme\nThe Russian colleagues will be investigating the upper ocean layer and sea ice, as well as snow cover. Atmospheric measurements of meteorological parameters such as temperature, wind, humidity and air pressure, will be added through recordings of trace gases such as carbon dioxide and ozone. Jürgen Graeser will examine two topics. On the one hand, he will use a captive balloon system to measure meteorological parameters in the so-called planetary boundary layer, which is the lowest layer of the atmosphere extending to approximately 1500 metres. In addition, he will use ozone sensors to measure the ozone layer in the stratosphere up to approximately 30 kilometres altitude.\nJürgen Graeser has been a technician at the research unit Potsdam of the Alfred Wegener Institute and has many years of experience with Arctic and Antarctic expeditions. His special areas of interest are aerology and meteorology. His expertise includes balloon-based, radiation and meteorological measurements.\nThe Arctic represents a key region for global climate change. Measurements of sea ice and atmospheric parameters in the Arctic Ocean are still incomplete. Through the current project, researchers intend to identify key processes in the atmosphere and alterations of the sea ice cover in order to examine the coupling of sea ice and atmosphere. The project is one of many during the International Polar Year. More than 50,000 scientists and technical staff from over 60 countries are joining force to explore the polar regions. Their goal is to study the role of the Arctic and Antarctic in shaping the climate and the earth's ecosystems.\nProject 'Planetary Boundary Layer'\nThe planetary boundary layer (PBL) identifies the lowest atmospheric layer, extending from the surface to approximately 1500 metres altitude. In the Arctic, this layer is characterised by frequent temperature inversions, i.e. by very stable atmospheric stratification which suppresses vertical movements of the air. A realistic representation of the planetary boundary layer is crucial for the construction of climate models, as it is this layer that determines the lower marginal conditions for all calculations. Particularly, the investigation of processes influenced directly by the boundary layer, requires exact knowledge of the state of the PBL.\nAWI scientists in Potsdam use the regional climate model HIRHAM to construct mesoscale fields of pressure, temperature and wind in which cyclones (low pressure regions) and their trajectories are identified. Specifically, they are examining the relationship between cyclone development and various surface conditions (e.g. sea ice cover). Elucidating the connection between the Arctic planetary boundary layer and mesoscale cyclones and their trajectories is the goal of these investigations.\nProject 'Ozone Layer'\nDiscovery of the Antarctic ozone hole in 1985 triggered intensive exploration efforts of the polar ozone layer. This layer is located between 15 and 25 kilometres altitude in the stratosphere. Many chemical processes of ozone depletion in the Antarctic have since been explained, and the connection of ozone destruction with anthropogenic emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons has been proven beyond doubt.\nDuring specific winters, severe ozone losses over the Arctic, and hence much closer to home, have already contributed to a reduction in ozone layer thickness over Europe -- leading to an increase of harmful ultraviolet radiation on the earth's surface. However, to date the ozone depletion in the Arctic is not as pronounced as over the Antarctic.\nCompared to the Arctic, ozone layer thickness in the Antarctic is much more variable, with only about half of the observed inter-annual variability explained by known chemical mechanisms. Hence, dynamic processes which remain only partly understood are equally important in determining thickness of the ozone layer over the Arctic as the chemical decomposition of ozone.\nAt the Arctic station of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Ny Ålesund on Spitsbergen (79°N), for instance, a strong annual ozone variation of 30 percent was detected at an altitude of 25 to 30 kilometres. Apparently, it is synchronised with variability of the sun, but cannot be explained by known chemical or other dynamic processes. Investigating the cause of this variability will be the focus of ozone measurements at NP-35.\nData records from the drifting station will, for the first time, produce high resolution vertical profiles of ozone distribution in the central Arctic, north of 82 degrees latitude -- currently a blank spot on the global ozone distribution map. These unique data will be combined with existing ozone profiles from the Arctic and Sub-Arctic. Calculations of air movement in conjunction with chemical models will contribute to an understanding of seasonal and annual variability of stratospheric ozone in the Arctic.\nOther social bookmarking and sharing tools:\nThe above story is reprinted from materials provided by Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, via EurekAlert!, a service of AAAS.\nNote: Materials may be edited for content and length.

    "By Andrew Freedman (Climate Central)\nRecently I reported on a study showing links between rapid Arctic climate change and shifts in the jet stream throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The study, led by Jennifer Francis of Rutgers University, suggests that there may be an Arctic connection to some extreme weather events, particularly ones that result from stuck, or \"blocked,\" weather patterns.\nThe study shows that by changing the temperature balance between the Arctic and mid-latitudes, rapid Arctic warming is altering the course of the jet stream, which steers weather systems from west to east around the hemisphere. The Arctic has been warming about twice as fast as the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, due to a combination of human emissions of greenhouse gases and unique feedbacks built into the Arctic climate system.\nThe jet stream, the study states, is becoming “wavier,” with steeper troughs and higher ridges. As a result, weather systems are progressing more slowly, raising the chances for long-duration extreme events, like droughts, floods, and heat waves.\nThis video looks great on an IPad, just select and expand.

    "Does this test have other names?\nWhat is this test?\nThis test looks for bacteria or other organisms in a wound. The test is used to find out if a wound is infected. It can also identify the type of organism that's causing the infection.\nThis test requires a small sample of cells or fluid from a wound. Then the sample is cultured and looked at under a microscope to look for bacteria or other organisms.\nAn infected wound may need special treatment, such as antibiotics. The antibiotics stop the infection and keep it from spreading to other areas of the body. Treating the infection also helps the wound to heal.\nWhy do I need this test?\nYou may need this test if your doctor suspects that your wound is infected or if you were bitten by an animal, insect, or another person.\nSymptoms of an infected wound include:\nSwelling or a sudden lump under the skin\nPus or bad-smelling fluid draining from the wound\nSkin around the wound that feels hot to the touch\nBumps near the wound that look like boils, pustules, spider bites, or a rash\nIn more advanced infections, you may also have exhaustion, confusion, fever, and chills.\nWhat other tests might I have along with this test?\nYour doctor may also order these tests:\nBlood tests, including those to check liver function, blood proteins, and blood sugar, as well as a complete blood count, or CBC\nWhat do my test results mean?\nMany things may affect your lab test results. These include the method each lab uses to do the test. Even if your test results are different from the normal value, you may not have a problem. To learn what the results mean for you, talk with your health care provider.\nNormal results are negative, meaning that no organisms grew in the culture from your wound. A positive result means that bacteria or other organisms did grow and that your wound is infected. From your test results, your doctor can determine what's causing the infection and give you the best antibiotic to treat it.\nHow is this test done?\nThis test requires a swab of the fluid or cells from an open wound. Your health care provider will carefully clean the wound and flush out any dirt with water. Then he or she will collect a sample using a long cotton swab to gently wipe the wound. If the wound isn't oozing, your doctor may moisten the swab with a sterile saline solution.\nDoes this test pose any risks?\nThis test poses no known risks.\nWhat might affect my test results?\nOther factors aren't likely to affect your results.\nHow do I get ready for this test?\nYou don't need to prepare for this test.",
    "To save energy and money, Nebraska irrigators should check their irrigation pumps for maximum efficiency, Tom Dorn, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln Extension educator, says.\nIrrigation pumps that operate at the average efficiency found in university tests are using 30% more energy than necessary, says Dorn, Extension educator in Lancaster County.\n\"At today's energy prices, identifying a pumping plant that needs adjustment or repair could save hundreds if not thousands of dollars per year,\" Dorn says. \"Now that irrigation season is over, look at your records and decide which of your pumping plants should be looked at by a professional. If you do it now, you have all winter and early spring to have those repairs made.\"\nThis and other cost saving tips to help deal with high input costs in crop production can be found at UNL's Surviving High Input Costs in Crop Production Web page at http://cropwatch.unl.edu/survivinghighinputcosts.htm.\nStatewide UNL pumping plant efficiency studies conducted on hundreds of farmer-owned pumping plants for the last 50 years were developed into the Nebraska Pumping Plant Performance Criteria. These criteria state the amount of useful work to expect for each unit of energy consumed by an irrigation pump.\nResults varied considerably – about 15% achieved good efficiency, leaving the other 85% using more energy per unit of work than expected by the criteria.\nThe tests revealed the overall average pumping plant in Nebraska is producing only 77% of the work that it should be for the fuel it is using, Dorn says.\nIf repairs are made to bring a typical diesel powered pumping plant operating at 77% of the performance criteria up to 100% of the criteria, it would result in an annual savings of nearly 800 gal. diesel/year, Dorn says.\n\"That's why it's important for farmers to know how much work is being done to pump the water versus the energy consumed,\" he says.\nWhen a pumping plant is not as efficient as it should be, the problem is either in the power unit or in the pump, or both, Dorn says.\n\"Internal combustion power units on irrigation pumps can have the same problems as those in cars and trucks,\" Dorn says. Poor electric motor efficiency is caused by bad bearings or a far larger motor than needed for the job.\nPoor pump performance can be caused by pump designs poorly matched to the job, such as when an operator switches from gated pipe to a center pivot sprinkler. It also can be caused by converting from a high-pressure sprinkler package to a lower-pressure package without changing the pump. Pumps with worn impeller vanes and/or internal seals as a result of pumping sand and impellers that were not properly adjusted within the pump bowls also can cause poor pump performance.\nIf making impeller adjustments, be sure they are performed by a qualified professional who knows how to calculate the lineshaft elongation that occurs when the pump is operating under load, he says.\n\"Great harm can be done to the pump if impellers are improperly adjusted,\" Dorn says. \"Don't attempt to adjust the impellers yourself unless you know how to account for lineshaft elongation based on your particular impeller model, lineshaft diameter and length and the total head the pump is producing.\"\nIn a study involving 130 farmer-owned pumping plants in Nebraska, test data revealed 58% benefited from adjustments, Dorn says. Field adjustments made with a wrench either to the engine or pump or both resulted in 14% average savings in energy costs compared to the initial test results.\nIn addition, inefficient pumping plants were identified and the feasibility of making repairs beyond the field adjustments were calculated.\nAn analysis, based on the average field pumping plant efficiency found in studies, is presented in the paper, Repair or Replace Inefficient Irrigation Pumping Plants. This paper is posted on UNL's Surviving High Input Costs Web site at http://cropwatch.unl.edu/survivinghighinputcosts.htm.\nAfter spending up to $17,000 for repairs, the annual extra profit averaged over a 20-year life was $16.51/acre/year after the cost of repairs were paid out of anticipated energy savings. Total added profit over 20 years was $41,288, assuming the average price of farm-delivered diesel fuel is $4/gal. over the 20-year period.",
    "Thyroid nodules is the name for those lumps that appear on the thyroid gland. Not all thyroid nodules are cancer, so do not panic in case you see you have this problem. There are multiple for thyroid nodules and it is important to go to the doctor to see what health problem you have. Usually, thyroid nodules are located at the edge of the gland or in the case of thin persons, they look a little bit strange, just as some lumps in your throat.\nThis is the first thyroid nodules symptoms, but there is also possible to be a combination between solid and liquid. The specialist who will examine you is called endocrinologist and the first thing that he will do, will be a psychical examination, followed by the blood tests, as well as an ultrasound. Also, there is possible to use very fine needles or histopathology. Other specialists who can also examine you are an otolaryngologist or a thyroidologist. Thyroid nodules are very common at adults and at children also.\nTo determine if the thyroid nodules are malign, it will be used fine needle biopsy. Thyroid nodules symptoms may consist of the breathing or swallowing problems and in these cases there can be increased chances that the nodules are malign, but only a test will tell you for sure. Another problems that appear when someone has thyroid nodules are the voice problems and you will put on weight. It is important to see which is the level of the hormones that are released by the thyroid gland. However, generally speaking, the percent of malign thyroid nodules is not high, but this does not mean that you do not have to go to the doctor. As you already know, it is better to prevent than to treat. It is good that if you go in time, there are great treatments that will have great results for your health and the issues have very increased chances to be solved in a short period of time.",

    "Dear parents! Your regular exercise routine may set habit in your kids\nWashington D.C. [USA], Jan. 10 : Dear parents, if you exercise regularly, then it can directly affect the health of your kids in childhood as well as adulthood.\nA new study suggests that kids aged three to five are more likely to be physically active if their parents increase activity and reduce sedentary lifestyle.\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, examined the impact of parent modeling of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in low-income American ethnic minorities, included data from more than 1,000 parent-child pairs.\nThe participants live in metro areas of Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota and Nashville, Tennessee.\nEach parent and child wore an accelerometer for an average of 12 hours a day, for a week.\nThis is the first study to link the physical activity of parents and young children by objectively measuring that physical activity with such a long wear time for an accelerometer.\nResearchers from Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the US found that the preschoolers' total physical activity was 6.03 hours per day with 1.5 hours spent in moderate to vigorous activity.\n\"This study highlights how important parents' physical activity is to shaping their young children's physical activity,\" said principal investigator Shari Barkin.\n\"The good news is that increasing physical activity is not only good for parents' health, it also helps set these behaviours in their young children as well. It's doubly good for family health. Setting this habit early could impact good health not only in childhood but in adulthood as well,\" Barkin added.\nPhysical activity is a critical factor for preventing childhood obesity and promoting good cardiovascular health.\nRecommendations call for preschoolers is to obtain about three hours a day of total physical activity (light, moderate and vigorous) with at least one hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).\nThe reports show that less than half of preschoolers actually achieve that recommendation.\nThey also found that up to 40 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity by a parent correlated with their preschool-age child's level of MVPA.\nSimilarly, for every minute a parent engaged in light physical activity, the child's light physical activity increased by 0.06 minutes.

    "Weird as it seems, this summer’s scary news stories about drought and global water crisis took a load off my shoulders – and allowed me to come clean with a dirty secret I’ve kept from neighbours and friends for almost 20 years.\nIt goes back to an article I wrote during the early 1990s about composting toilet manufacturer Abby Rockefeller, who taught me that water could be put to higher uses than moving human sewage – black water, it’s sometimes called – through pipes to be flung into the nearest river or lake. Rockefeller was equally passionate about the ‘grey water’ from sinks and bathtubs. Her idea was to separate out grey water to irrigate gardens, from black water that could be converted to fertilizer, thereby keeping both out of the sewage pipes and lakes. As with regular garbage, resources only get wasted as garbage when they’re commingled – whence Rockefeller’s slogan that ‘waste is a verb, not a noun’.\nEver since that interview, I’ve been sneaking down early in the morning or late at night to pour rinse water from cleaning cans and pots on my three-by-four-metre front garden. ‘It’s a scientific experiment,’ I’d explain whenever neighbours caught me in the act.\nActually, my 20-year experiment shows that a wild garden with two bushes and one fast-growing oak can thrive on the combination of rain and grey water, with no need for a garden hose. The water is poured directly over plant roots, so there’s no loss to evaporation. And the film of cleaning liquid and food particles – harmful as sewage because they feed algae in lakes and consume oxygen that fish need – break down as nutrients in the soil. Plus, avoiding water from the hose is appreciated by plants, which like their water soft and free of municipal chlorine and fluoride.\nTo get back to this season’s water crisis, it’s the rich opportunities for reuse and recycling – not the scarcity – that should focus municipal debate about water. Actually, conserving or cutting back on water use is only a drop in the bucket of the water cycle-based strategy that’s needed.\nMost cities have plenty of water to go around, when the water goes through a full water cycle. Indeed, including plant watering as part of the water cycle is one reason why agriculture in cities is such a natural, and why, in some cases, city gardens are better than rural farms for growing water-intensive crops such as fruits and vegetables. After all, the reason cities have so much waste is that they have no valuable place to put their under-appreciated resources.\nBeyond conservation are a series of opportunities to wring benefits from the priority uses of household and workplace water, and then return them to the water cycle in as good shape as possible.\nA case study of bio-mimicry\nTo expand on my little experiment, we could start by capturing rain water on the roof and using it for dishwater – a nice trick because rain water is soft and needs less soap. Once used as dishwater, the grey water could be piped to the garden, where the piping hot water would not only fertilize plants but carry the heat from the dishwater to warm the soil and add some season extension to the garden in early spring and late fall – thereby creating a hospitable environment for a wide range of fruits and vegetables valued in a multicultural city. Some of the water that formerly would have been used for the dishwashing machine or garden hose could be diverted to aquaculture – small neighbourhood fisheries for tilapia and other species that tolerate still waters – which supplies lean protein for humans and nutrient-rich water for yet more garden plants. Filtered clean by plants and soil, that water would fall to the water table and then be returned to the water cycle.\nUrban agriculture and aquaculture help the water cycle work the same way they do in nature. It’s a case study of bio-mimicry.\nCities have many other ways to use water, and the heat or cool it carries at different stages, resourcefully. Toronto, for example, keeps many of its downtown office towers cool with ‘deepwater cooling’, cold water from deep in Lake Ontario piped through office buildings to keep them cool, thereby providing a low-cost form of solar air-conditioning.\nAlternatively, green roofs, as mandated for large buildings in Toronto, capture rain water, keeping it out of the sewers and saving it for plants that evaporate the water on hot summer days, thereby cooling the city, again thanks to low-cost solar power. A lot better than letting rain fall aimlessly into sewers, usually ending up as swill, full of the flotsam and jetsam of city streets, which is often dumped untreated in lakes and rivers.\nSometimes green infrastructure comes as cheap as a law protecting near-city green belts, rich with swamp and other all-natural soil and earth filters and regulators of water. Economists Sara Wilson and Michelle Molnar, reporting on Toronto’s green belt for the David Suzuki Foundation last May, estimated that regional marshes and forests save typical households over $380 a year in residential water treatment bills.\nProblem or opportunity?\nIn all likelihood, advancing global warming will bring drought more often to areas that have seldom faced it over the last few thousand years. Such droughts will more frequently afflict dryland areas that have long served as ‘breadbaskets’ of the world, at the very moment in history when expanding human populations most require the staple crops that they have produced. Anxiety about this has led many, such as Inter Press Service food analyst Stephen Leahy, to worry about what will happen to a world that requires the equivalent irrigation of 20 Nile or 100 Colorado Rivers a year.\nI do not want to minimize the need to conserve water. At the same time, it’s still possible, especially in cities, to see the problem of water shortage as a series of opportunities disguised as a problem, as the old saying goes.\nThe real problem is more of our own making than that of the climate. We have governments that treat water and food in separate ministries and departments, though neither can exist without the other. Food cannot grow without water. Likewise, the water cycle cannot exist without plants and animals that use both its liquid asset and the heat or cool it carries.\nCities offer the most visible opportunities for bringing those two essential resources – the food cycle and the water cycle – together for their own mutual benefit and ours. That is the context in which reuse and recycling of water will thrive.",

    "By Show and Tell\nBy Byron Graham\nBy Jamie Siebrase\nBy Bree Davies\nBy Zoe Yabrove\nBy Zoe Yabrove\nBy Jamie Siebrase\nBy Emilie Johnson\nBetween the First World War and the 1930s, the United States experienced an internal population shift unprecedented in its history. More than 1 million rural blacks left their sharecropper farms in the South and came north in search of factory jobs and better living conditions in the industrialized urban centers of the East and the Midwest.\nNot even the great westward expansion of the late nineteenth century took place on this scale. Yet, unlike the way west, which has spawned entire genres in literature, film and the fine arts, the way north has barely been talked about. It did, however, inspire at least one artist: Jacob Lawrence. In the early 1940s he painted a group of sixty closely interrelated panels immortalizing this tremendous movement of people. The resulting mammoth painting cycle is the subject of Jacob Lawrence: The Migration Series, now on display at the Denver Art Museum.\nThe traveling show was organized by Elizabeth Hutton Turner, an associate curator at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., which has been the repository of thirty of the Lawrence paintings since soon after they were presented in 1941. The remaining thirty were acquired at the same time by New York's Museum of Modern Art. The current exhibit marks the first time in more than fifty years that all sixty paintings have been shown together.\nLawrence, who now lives in Seattle, was not a southern migrant himself. \"I had never even been to the South until the series had been completed,\" he said during a recent visit to Denver. But he was familiar with the subject. \"My father was from North Carolina, my mother from Virginia,\" he told the crowd at a reception held to mark the opening of the new show. \"Thus I had Southern mores.\"\nBorn in Atlantic City, Lawrence moved from Pennsylvania to New York's Harlem as a teenager in 1930. Harlem was then the center of black culture in America, and the Harlem Renaissance was in full swing. Lawrence blossomed in this environment. \"Harlem was vital at the time,\" he recalled. \"You could hear the great writers talk. The influence of Harlem remains with me sixty years later.\"\nBut it was also the time of the Great Depression, which had a profound effect on the art world. \"Most galleries were forced to close,\" said Lawrence. Yet the artist called the 1930s \"one of the most creative periods of the century.\" What made the difference, he said, were New Deal programs such as the Works Progress Administration and the Fine Arts Project.\nIn 1935, when Lawrence was only eighteen, he was hired by the FAP to produce two paintings every six weeks for $23 per week--\"which was good money.\" He remained with the FAP until 1940. (Lawrence feels that federal support for the arts at the time was essential to his career, and imminent budget cuts at the National Endowment for the Arts are heavy on his mind. \"Many of the WPA murals were covered later because they were deemed pornographic or too political,\" he said. \"Times repeat themselves.\")\nLawrence was recruited into the FAP by the noted African-American sculptor Augusta Savage. Her decision to lend him support was \"the highlight of my life,\" Lawrence said. But Savage's traditional three-dimensional sculptures had no discernable effect on Lawrence's painting and printmaking. Instead, Lawrence embraced Modernism. And though he claims that \"feelings were more important than art influences\" in providing him with inspiration, it's impossible not to see his work as being totally of its time, closely related to the work of other now-famous artists then working in New York.\nThe Migration Series was intended to depict the struggles of the oppressed--a concept then being broadly embraced by many artists. The idea that art can be used to tell a story was another mainstream idea. Taking advantage of the resources of Harlem's Schomburg Center for Black Research, Lawrence devoted weeks to researching the Great Migration. But in retrospect, he said at the reception, the research he did wasn't nearly as important a factor as the people he met. \"It was the Harlem community--teachers and librarians,\" he said, who ultimately provided the concept for the series.\nLawrence was doubtless affected by Haitian painting and folk art, two of the many aspects of black culture he researched at the Schomburg. However, the draw of the almost exclusively white art world centered in Greenwich Village also shaped his approach. Specific stylistic affinities can be seen in Lawrence's paintings and contemporaneous works by older and more established white artists like Milton Avery, Stuart Davis and Ben Shahn. Like those Modern artists' works, Lawrence's paintings are characterized by compositional simplicity, a strong graphic sense in the design of the pictures and the use of bright colors employed against dark ones. He was surely aware of the work of the other Moderns, since he, like Davis and Shahn, was represented by Edith Halpert's Downtown Gallery.\nSignificantly, Lawrence's relationship with the Downtown Gallery, where The Migration Series was first shown, marked the end of segregation in the art world. Even before his teachers, Lawrence became one of the first African-American artists to be represented by a commercial gallery. Previously, only public institutions provided blacks with exhibition opportunities.\nThe sixty individual paintings in The Migration Series, each one numbered, are all the same small size--eighteen by twelve inches, still an art-supply-shop standard. Some are vertically oriented, some horizontally, an arrangement that creates visual interest without sacrificing unity--which is particularly important, since Lawrence saw them \"not as individual panels but as a single work of art.\" In fact, Lawrence says he was so committed to the series' \"oneness\" that he \"worked the colors,\" painting the black portions of all sixty panels, then the yellow portions, and so on until the series was complete.\nIn addition to the paintings in The Migration Series, another historical exhibit meant to connect us with Lawrence and his time is presented in an adjacent gallery. There are some problems with this presentation, not the least of which is that it includes a reproduction of one of the panels in an elephantine enlargement. I think it's the first time I've ever seen a reproduction in an art museum. What were the out-of-town organizers thinking?\nAnother, better exhibit that also complements the Lawrence show is The Narratives Continue, which features work by black artists from the permanent collection of DAM's Modern and Contemporary department. A real standout here is the masterful 1963 painting \"The Procession,\" by an African-American in Paris named Bob Thompson. The painting reveals a debt to Lawrence's work, particularly The Migration Series. Later this fall the show promises a rare sighting of Floyd Tunson's very different \"Before and After,\" a mural-sized acrylic painting. Unfortunately, Tunson's from Colorado--the reason, apparently, why he's forced to time-share gallery space at the museum.",

    "Activated 1 March 1942 at Salt Lake City AB, Utah. They trained there until the 2nd of March 1943. Then moved to Geiger Field, Washington on 11 June 1942 Intensive training at Muroc Lake AB, California from the 29t June to 20th August 1942. The ground unit went by train to at Fort Dix, New Jersey. The ground unit sailed on the Queen Mary on the 5th September 1942, and disembarked from Greenock on the 12th of September 1942. the Aircraft assembled at Syracuse, New York and spent six weeks in advance flight training. They received new B-17F bombers, and left for the United Kingdom in October 1942 via the presque Isle, and Gander to Prestwick.\nClaims to Fame\nUnder Col. LeMay the Group pioneered many formations and bombing procedures that became Standard Operating Procedures in the 8th AAF The 422nd Bomb Squadron undertook the first night attacks by the 8th AF Suffered heaviest loss of the 14th October 1943 Schweinfurt mission, and for this reason was given the Nazi flag found flying in the city when it was captured by the US troops Subsequent History Between 20-27 July 1945 the Group moved to\nSt. Trond, Belgium, where it conducted photo-mapping flights which was called Project: Casey Jones over Europe and North Africa. On the 15th December 1945 moved to Lechfeld, Germany which they had bombed on the 18th March 1944. The 364th Bomb Squadron was inactivated on the 1st of July 1946. The 423 Bomb Squadron of the 306th Bomb Group was attached to the Group after this date but by the end of October 1946 the Group ceased all operations. Officially the unit was inactivated on the 25th of December 1946. On the Continent came under the 9th Air Force and on the 15th of November 1945 under USAFE. The unit was reactivated in 1951 as a Strategic Air Command B-29 unit and as the 305th Bomb Wing and converted to B-47s in 1953. Then became one of the USAF's two B-58 Hustler units.\nCol. LeMay and the 305th Bombardment Group 1.\n\"An assignment to hell\" The United Press correspondent, Walter Cronkite, reported that above 20,000 feet he and his colleagues could no longer make notes; the cold actually froze the lead of the pencils. Cronkite summed up the bomber mission as \"an assignment to hell-a hell 20,000 feet above the earth.\".\n2. New survival tactics As aids to survival, the Eighth Air Force kept devising new equipment and tactics. The crewmen were given new \"vests\" to protect them from flak. Made of overlapping two - inch - square steel plates on top of heavy canvas, the flak vest proved to be so effective that one bombardier survived unhurt when a 20mm cannon shell exploded only two feet away from his chest. Another innovation that was gradually replacing the crews' leather and fleece - lined clothing was the electric flying suit; it could be plugged in at air receptacles inside the bomber.\n3. \"Iron Ass\" LeMay The new tactics that were worked out had two principal aims: to increase bombing precision and to make the massed bomber formations more invulnerable to Luftwaffe attack. Some of the methods were devised by an irascible, cigar - chomping 36 - year - old Ohioan, Colonel Curtis E. LeMay, who commanded the 305th Bombardment Group. LeMay was such a slave driver that his men called him \"Iron Ass.\" In their dispatches home, American correspondents softened the term to \"Iron Pants, \" only to earn LeMay's scornful charge that they feared \"offending some delicate old - maid type readers.\"\n4. The \"combat box\" LeMay was never to curb his notorious penchant for plain speaking, but in the winter of 1943 he was better known for two tactical innovations. The first was the flying formation known as the \"combat box.\" In contrast to the loose bomber stream used in the British night missions, the Americans' choice of a daylight strategy had required their planes to be tightly bunched for effective defense against attack. LeMay's combat box further strengthened the defense. It consisted of as many as 21 planes staggered vertically and horizontally in such a way that the bombers' guns provided maximum firepower all around, and especially against head - on attacks. On large raids, three of these boxes were formed into a combat wing, with one box in the lead and the others stacked 1,000 feet above and below it.\n5. The lead crew LeMay's second innovation, designed to increase bombing accuracy, was to place his most proficient crews in the lead planes of the combat boxes. All the planes in the box dropped their bombs simultaneously-but only at the signal of the lead crew. The result, at least in theory, was a closely packed pattern of hits on the target.",
    "From the time of Aristotle (384-322 BC) until the late 1500’s, gravity was believed to act differently on different objects.\n- Drop a metal bar and a feather at the same time… which one hits the ground first?\n- Obviously, common sense will tell you that the bar will hit first, while the feather slowly flutters to the ground.\n- In Aristotle’s view, this was because the bar was being pulled harder (and faster) by gravity because of its physical properties.\n- Because everyone sees this when they drop different objects, it wasn’t questioned for almost 2000 years.\nGalileo Galilei was the first major scientist to refute (prove wrong) Aristotle’s theories.\n- In his famous (at least to Physicists!) experiment, Galileo went to the top of the leaning tower of Pisa and dropped a wooden ball and a lead ball, both the same size, but different masses.\n- They both hit the ground at the same time, even though Aristotle would say that the heavier metal ball should hit first.\n- Galileo had shown that the different rates at which some objects fall is due to air resistance, a type of friction.\n- Get rid of friction (air resistance) and all objects will fall at the same rate.\n- Galileo said that the acceleration of any object (in the absence of air resistance) is the same.\n- To this day we follow the model that Galileo created.\nag = g = 9.81m/s2\nag = g = acceleration due to gravity\nSince gravity is just an acceleration like any other, it can be used in any of the formulas that we have used so far.\n- Just be careful about using the correct sign (positive or negative) depending on the problem.\nExamples of Calculations with Gravity\nExample 1: A ball is thrown up into the air at an initial velocity of 56.3m/s. Determine its velocity after 4.52s have passed.\nIn the question the velocity upwards is positive, and I’ll keep it that way. That just means that I have to make sure that I use gravity as a negative number, since gravity always acts down.\nvf = vi + at\n= 56.3m/s + (-9.81m/s2)(4.52s)\nvf = 12.0 m/s\nThis value is still positive, but smaller. The ball is slowing down as it rises into the air.\nExample 2: I throw a ball down off the top of a cliff so that it leaves my hand at 12m/s. Determine how fast is it going 3.47 seconds later.\nIn this question I gave a downward velocity as positive. I might as well stick with this, but that means I have defined down as positive. That means gravity will be positive as well.vf = vi + at\n= 12m/s + (9.81m/s2)(3.47s)\nvf = 46 m/s\nHere the number is getting bigger. It’s positive, but in this question I’ve defined down as positive, so it’s speeding up in the positive direction.\nExample 3: I throw up a ball at 56.3 m/s again. Determine how fast is it going after 8.0s.\nWe’re defining up as positive again.\nvf = vi + at\n= 56.3m/s + (-9.81m/s2)(8.0s)\nvf = -22 m/s\nWhy did I get a negative answer?\n- The ball reached its maximum height, where it stopped, and then started to fall down.\n- Falling down means a negative velocity.\nThere’s a few rules that you have to keep track of. Let’s look at the way an object thrown up into the air moves.\nAs the ball is going up…\n- It starts at the bottom at the maximum speed.\n- As it rises, it slows down.\n- It finally reaches it’s maximum height, where for a moment its velocity is zero.\n- This is exactly half ways through the flight time.\nAs the ball is coming down…\n- The ball begins to speed up, but downwards.\n- When it reaches the same height that it started from, it will be going at the same speed as it was originally moving at.\n- It takes just as long to go up as it takes to come down.\nExample 4: I throw my ball up into the (again) at a velocity of 56.3 m/s.\na) Determine how much time does it take to reach its maximum height.\n- It reaches its maximum height when its velocity is zero. We’ll use that as the final velocity.\n- Also, if we define up as positive, we need to remember to define down (like gravity) as negative.\na = (vf - vi) / t\nt = (vf - vi) / a\n= (0 - 56.3m/s) / -9.81m/s2\nt = 5.74s\nb) Determine how high it goes.\n- It’s best to try to avoid using the number you calculated in part (a), since if you made a mistake, this answer will be wrong also.\n- If you can’t avoid it, then go ahead and use it.\nvf2 = vi2 + 2ad\nd = (vf2 = vi2) / 2a\n= (0 - 56.32) / 2(-9.81m/s2)\nd = 1.62e2 m\nc) Determine how fast is it going when it reaches my hand again.\n- Ignoring air resistance, it will be going as fast coming down as it was going up.\nYou might have heard people in movies say how many \"gee’s\" they were feeling.\n- All this means is that they are comparing the acceleration they are feeling to regular gravity.\n- So, right now, you are experiencing 1g… regular gravity.\n- During lift-off the astronauts in the space shuttle experience about 4g’s.\n- That works out to about 39m/s2.\n- Gravity on the moon is about 1.7m/s2 = 0.17g",

    "Whose Music is it Anyway? How We Came to View Musical Expression as a Form of Property\nMany participants in the music industry consider unauthorized transmissions of music files over the Internet to be theft of their property. Many Internet users who exchange music files reject this characterization. Prompted by the dispute over unauthorized music distribution, this Article explores how those who create and distribute music first came to look upon music as their property and when in Western history the law first supported this view. By analyzing the economic and legal structures governing music making in Western Europe from the classical period in Greece through the Renaissance, the Article shows that the law first granted some exclusive rights in the Middle Ages, when musicians' guilds enjoyed the exclusive right to perform music in medieval cities, but that the concept of music as a form of property was not established until early music publishers received exclusive rights in their publications during the Renaissance. The Article concludes with thoughts about how this history should influence the way we address the current controversy concerning uses of music on the Internet.\nCarroll, Michael W. \"Whose Music is it Anyway?

    "It's a good news for those suffering from spinal cord paralysis. Northwestern University scientists have developed a brain-computer interface that can successfully replace the functions of spinal cord and help people once again use their previously paralyzed limbs in daily life. Supported by National Institutes of Health in this pursuit, the invention gives a ray of hope to about 130000 people who sustain spinal cord injuries every year with about 50 percent of them getting completely paralyzed below neck. Scientists performed a number of tests to check the effectiveness of the technique. Surprisingly, it improved the grasping precision significantly and allowed voluntary adjustment of force and strength.\nThe study was conducted on a rhesus monkey whose arm was temporarily paralyzed with an anesthetic. It comprises of the brain-computer interface, which is wired directly into 10o neurons in motor cortex along with a functional electrical stimulation (FES) device, which is wired into subject's paralyzed body part ( subject's arm in this case). As soon as the monkey tried to move his hand the neurons get activated, which in turn send data to the brain-computer interface. The interface predicts, which muscles to move with what force and passes this information to FES. FES activates the desired body part and this gives the required movement.\nCurrently, the system can perform only basic body movements such as lifting arm, opening hand etc. The movements in human body are much more complex and according to scientists they need to go through the process of motor learning to be able to use the device.",
    "If genealogy books were rated by the pound, the book I examined this week would be number one. I don't recall ever picking up a single genealogy book as thick and heavy as this one. Of course, genealogy books are not graded by heft.

Best of all, nearly every page is full of high-quality, well-researched genealogy information.\nMagna Carta (Latin for \"Great Charter\") is a document written in 1215 A.D. that serves as the charter of England which limited the power of English monarchs. King John was the ruler at the time, and he ruled with an iron fist, much to the chagrin of his noblemen. The barons of England organized numerous uprisings. In the face of such strong and well-organized opposition, King John was forced to renounce certain rights and to grant a charter of liberties. This document stated that the King would respect certain legal procedures and accept the premise that the will of the king could be bound by law. Magna Carta is widely considered to be the first step in a long historical process leading to the rule of constitutional law.\nMagna Carta was signed in the meadow at Runnymede on June 15, 1215. Numerous disagreements arose immediately, and King John soon refuted it. A civil war then erupted. In the midst of this war, King John died of dysentery on October 18, 1216. His death quickly changed the nature of the war. His nine-year-old son, King Henry III, was soon crowned King of England. The civil war stopped, and a somewhat modified Magna Carta was issued. When he turned eighteen in 1225, Henry III himself reissued Magna Carta a third time, this time in a shorter version with only 37 articles.\nThe twenty-five barons who signed the Magna Carta were the leading nobles of England at the time. Most were married, and many had large families. Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of people alive today can trace their ancestry back to one or more of these twenty-five barons. Indeed, this book, Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, lists 238 Colonial-era immigrants to the United States with proven descent from the Magna Carta barons. If one of these immigrants is in your family tree, this book will trace your ancestry back to the meadow at Runnymede in 1215 A.D.\nThis scholarly book features thousands of biographical sketches of people who lived in medieval England and their descendants through to those who immigrated to America. The book also contains more than 28,000 source citations to published materials, making it the most documented source book of its kind. In fact, the extensive cross-referencing makes the text simple to follow. The book also contains a 93-page bibliography, probably the most exhaustive listing of medieval genealogy and history ever published. Finally, Magna Carta Ancestry contains an index of over 18,000 entries.\nAuthor Doug Richardson has refuted numerous published genealogies in this new book, pointing to source citations that disprove many lineages that have been accepted for decades. If you believe that you have royal or noble English ancestry, you need to check this book!\nMany new additions to the book show the lineages of colonial immigrants that previously were unknown. As a result, many people will be able to claim noble ancestry for the first time.\nWhile the primary audience for this book is anyone with American ancestry in the Colonial era, the book contains extensive biographical information about thousands of individuals who lived in England between 1215 and the 17th century. As such, the information will be of interest to anyone with ancestry in England, even if their later ancestors moved to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or elsewhere.\nA complete list of the 17th-century American immigrants with proven Magna Carta ancestry can be found on the publisher's web site at http://www.genealogical.com/item_detail.asp?afid=&ID=4887\nMagna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, by Douglas Richardson will be the standard reference for many, many years.

    "- An individual's ability to cope with stressful situations may indicate their vulnerability to alcoholism.\n- Both alcohol and stress are known to have an impact on the β-endorphin system.\n- New findings show that dysfunction in the activity of the pituitary β-endorphin system predates the development of alcoholism among individuals with a family history of alcoholism; dysfunction develops following alcohol dependence among individuals without a family history of alcoholism.\nA number of sociocultural studies indicate that stress may increase the risk of alcoholism. In other words, an individual's ability to cope with stressful situations may indicate his or her vulnerability to alcoholism. A study in the November issue of Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research has found that individuals with a family history of alcoholism exhibit a dysfunction in their stress response prior to the development of alcohol dependence, while individuals without a family history of alcoholism exhibit a dysfunction in their stress response following the development of alcohol dependence.\n\"It is not well understood how stress increases alcohol consumption, or what the relationship is between stress and alcohol,\" said Christina Gianoulakis, a professor in the department of psychiatry at McGill University and corresponding author for the study. \"One of the questions we wanted to ask is whether alcohol induces a number of biological responses that help the individual cope with a stressful situation. If that is the case, then the alteration of the activity of biological systems by both alcohol and stress may help us to understand the relationship between stress and alcohol. One such biological system is that of brain and pituitary β-endorphin.\"\nBoth Gianoulakis and Maurice Dongier, professor emeritus in the department of psychiatry at McGill University, agree that the effect of stress on β-endorphin is clear and well defined. \"Stress increases the release of β-endorphin by both the pituitary gland and the brain,\" said Dongier. \"But the effect of alcohol is not as clear. It is, in fact, somewhat contradictory.\"\nGianoulakis said that a specific response may depend on the dose of alcohol as well as the species involved. \"For example, in experimental animals such as rats, all doses of alcohol increase the release of β-endorphin,\" she said. \"However, in humans low doses of alcohol have either no or a small effect on β-endorphin release, whereas high doses of alcohol are needed to induce a significant increase in β-endorphin release.\"\nFor this study, four groups of individuals participated: social and heavy drinkers with a family history of alcoholism (considered \"high risk\") and without a family history of alcoholism (considered \"low risk\"). Each participant was given either a placebo or alcohol (0.50g ethanol/kg) drink; researchers then measured their responses to both drinks as well as a stress test performed 30 minutes following ingestion. The stress test had two components: arithmetic computations, and a competition for monetary reward. Plasma β-endorphin levels were also measured prior to and for 3.5 hours after the stress test.\nResults indicate that there are differences in both the basal plasma β-endorphin levels as well as the response of the pituitary β-endorphin to stress as a function of an individual's family history of alcohol problems.\n\"There are two major findings in this study,\" said Gianoulakis. \"In participants with a family history of alcoholism, the lower activity of the pituitary β-endorphin system indicated by the low basal plasma β-endorphin levels and the lower β-endorphin response to stress predate the development of alcoholism, and alcohol dependence does not induce a further decrease in the activity of the pituitary β-endorphin system. However, in subjects without a family history of alcoholism, alcohol dependence induces a decrease of the activity of pituitary β-endorphin, as indicated by the lower basal plasma β-endorphin levels and the lower β-endorphin response to stress.\" In other words, said Gianoulakis, in high-risk individuals, dysfunction in the activity of the pituitary β-endorphin system predates the development of alcoholism; while in low-risk individuals, dysfunction develops following alcohol dependence.\n\"The second important finding is that when participants of all four groups ingested a small amount of alcohol, the equivalent of about two standard drinks, the stress task performed 30 minutes after the drink did not increase the release of β-endorphin,\" said Gianoulakis. \"Thus, prior alcohol consumption blocked or decreased the β-endorphin response to stress regardless of family history of alcoholism and presence of alcohol dependence.\"\nGianoulakis added it was important to note that stress dysfunction can both act as a mediator of alcohol dependence and occur as a consequence of alcohol dependence. \"The major objective of a biological response to stress is to help that individual cope with a stressful situation,\" she said. \"A low response to stress may compromise an individual's ability to cope, so that he or she feels the need to search for alternative ways to cope with stress, one of which could be drinking, eventually leading to alcohol dependence. Conversely, we also found that alcohol dependence can induce a decrease of the β-endorphin response to stress in individuals without a family history of alcoholism, eventually compromising their responses to stress and his or her ability to cope with stressful situations. They may cope with subsequent stress by increasing alcohol consumption, which not only prevents recovery of the stress response but may also induce a further dysfunction of the stress response.\"\nBoth Gianoulakis and Dongier said that one group in particular – individuals with a family history of alcoholism – needs to be aware of their potentially greater risk of developing alcohol problems.\n\"Individuals with a family history of alcoholism exhibit a dysfunction of the stress response prior to the development of alcohol dependence,\" said Gianoulakis. \"These individuals may have a greater vulnerability to stressful situations, and should try to avoid drinking alcohol in the face of stress, as well as develop alternative behavioural skills for coping with stress.\"\nSource: Eurekalert & othersLast reviewed: By John M.

    "Self-Reliance in a Power Outage\nPeople do not usually think of a power outage in the same light as an earthquake. However, when the power is out for a long period of time, citizen requests for fire, police, medical, and other public services will begin to mount. At some point, the increased demand for services could result in delayed response times.\nFor this reason, every citizen should learn to be self-reliant in an emergency. And even though power outages may only last a few hours, individuals and organizations should be prepared to be without assistance for 72 hours or longer.\nTo assist individuals prepare for an emergency, the City of San Mateo, State of California, American Red Cross, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company have provided information on what to do during a power outage or other emergency.\n- Check Circuit Breakers. If your power goes out, check your home's circuit breakers or fuses first. Your power could be out because a circuit has tripped or a fuse has blown.\n- Report Electrical Outages. See if the lights in your neighborhood are off. Contact the local electric utility to report an outage.\n- Power Lines. If you can see any power lines on the ground, stay at least 10 feet away from them as electricity might still be flowing through the lines.\n- Sensitive Appliances. Protect appliances from possible power surges when electricity is restored. Unplug appliances and computers, if possible, and turn off non-essential lights.\n- Keep Food Cold. Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to help prevent food spoilage. Refrigerated foods should remain safe to eat for four hours. Food in a closed freezer can stay frozen for up to two days. If in doubt, throw it out.\n- Dry Ice. Add dry or block ice to the freezer to help keep food frozen. Never add dry ice with your bare hands or place directly on top of food.\n- Water. Discontinue non-essential water usage. Do not drink cloudy or dirty water. Don't be alarmed if chlorine level is higher than normal. Notify water officials of low or no water pressure.\n- Stay Cool. During hot days, stay cool indoors and drink plenty of fluids.\n- Check on Neighbors. Check on elderly or medically dependent neighbors.\n- Life Support Equipment. If someone in your household uses life support equipment, make arrangements for a back-up power supply.\n- Generators. Establish independent, short-term power supplies such as generators or battery-operated devices. If you own a generator, never plug it into any electric outlet in your home. Instead, plug appliances directly into the generator.\n- Monitor Radio and Television. Monitor battery operated radio or television for current information on the outage.\n- Telephones. A telephone that does not depend on electricity. Cordless phones will not function during an outage.\n- Garage Doors. Know how to manually release and open any electric doors, like garage doors.\n- Security Gates. Find out the steps needed to take to open and close security gates.\n- House Numbers. Ensure house numbers are readily visible from the street for emergency response.\n- Anticipate Traffic Delays. Intersections should be treated as four-way stops when traffic lights are out. Anticipate long traffic delays in areas where the power is out.",
    "Hristo Bojinov wants you to forget your password. More precisely, he wants you to never really know it in the first place. Bojinov, a computer scientist at Stanford, and his colleagues have developed a computer program that can implant passwords in a person’s subconscious mind--and retrieve them subconsciously too. The technique could make it impossible for, say, a high-security government agent to reveal his password; the agent wouldn’t actually know the secret code. Eventually, the use of subconscious passwords could even trickle down to the rest of us. And considering the precarious state of password protection, that probably can’t happen soon enough.\n“The problem with passwords is that they are easy to breach,” says Ram Pemmaraju, the CTO of security company StrikeForce Technologies. The tools for cracking them, such as malware, are easy to come by. New processors and open-source software can break an encrypted password in days, if not hours or minutes. Take a seven-character password with upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Five to 10 years ago, the average computer would have needed more than 1,000 years to guess it. Today’s home computers can do it in about a month. Because of this increasing computer power, some experts recommend 20- to 30-character passwords. But human laziness is also a huge problem. Who wants to remember a 30-character password? One recent study found that 5 percent of passwords are some variation of “password.”\nIf a person could subconsciously learn a password, though, he would never have to bother memorizing it. He wouldn’t forget it by accident. And he’d never write it down on a Post-it note for others to find. Those are the benefits Bojinov had in mind this summer at the prestigious USENIX Security Symposium, where he presented his study--the first to show that people can subconsciously store passwords and retrieve them from their minds. In the experiment, participants learned a password by playing a computer game. On the screen, black circles fell one after another from the top to the bottom of six columns labeled S, D, F, J, K, and L. When a circle reached the bottom, the player typed the letter corresponding to that column. The game, which is nearly 4,000 keystrokes long, took about 30 to 45 minutes to complete. The players didn’t know it, but the game contained a password--a sequence of 30 letters that they typed in 105 times. By the time players finished the game, they knew the password well enough that it seemed slightly familiar, but they still couldn’t recognize it, let alone recite it. (On average, they rated the password’s familiarity as a 6 out of 10, and a random password as a 5 out of 10.)\nTo use the password, the participants played a 5- to 10-minute version of the game. This time, the software compared how accurately they typed the actual password versus randomly generated 30-letter sequences. Seventy-one percent of participants scored better on the real passwords than the fake ones. Playing the game two weeks later, 61 percent did.\nIn the future, people could use a similar game to log into their computers in the morning. But Bojinov cautions that the work is still preliminary. The learning process takes too long for the majority of people, he says, so he’s currently focused on honing the technique for high-security situations--the kinds of applications in which a 45-minute password ritual would be worth the trouble. He suggests that the system could be used as a form of secondary authentication, a substitute for the security questions now required to reset a password on an e-mail account. No matter what the application, Bojinov says researchers still need to answer critical questions about the technique. How can they make it work for more people? What’s the best way to speed up the process? And how long do subconscious passwords last?\nThe answers to those questions could lead to an interesting twist in password protection. Russell Dietz, CTO of data protection company SafeNet, says the current strategy is to secure a system against both human cleverness and human failure. “You want to prove that someone is who they are while eliminating the weak link—the human users themselves,” he says. But as Bojinov’s research demonstrates, human experience might be the thing that no other person, or computer, can fake.",
    "Returning from the flurry of the start of the semester, I want to consider the close of Coleridge’s “The Raven” (much as Tim has now brought to a close his wonderful readings of “The Rime”). When we last left our bird, he’d returned to the oak—now “grown a tall oak tree”—and brought along with him a “She.” The pair built themselves “a nest in the topmost bough, / And young ones they had, and were happy enow.” But avian tragedy ensues in full, dramatic measure:\nBut soon came a Woodman in leathern guise,\nHis brow, like a pent-house, hung over his eyes.\nHe’d an axe in his hand, not a word he spoke,\nBut with many a hem! and a sturdy stroke,\nAt length he brought down the poor Raven’s own oak.\nHis young ones were killed; for they could not depart,\nAnd their mother did die of a broken heart.\nMany a reader of Thoreau’s Walden will halt (“Pause, Dweller!”) at the text’s mention of the Woodman’s brow, pendulous “like a pent-house.” Coleridge may have adapted this simile of a slant-roofed forehead from Dryden’s description of “pent-house eye-brows” (King Arthur III.i.30). But the relation to dwelling, in this context of a woodman cutting down a tree that will be transformed into a ship, suggests more than appearance. The Woodman uncannily conveys lean-to houseness with him in his human bearing and attitudes: human ecology (conceptualized dwelling, houseness, the [un]heimlich) trumps and destroys an avian ecosystem and its dwellers. The Woodman’s “guise” moreover suggests something less than authentic, as if he were playing a role as an actor or agent of transformative dwelling: my dwelling from yours. So the poem’s vision of eco-nomy seems to go. The Raven’s “own oak,” dwelt in but not of course “owned” in human terms of commerce and property rights, is “brought down,” and the young birds, unable yet to fly, are “killed” by the Woodman’s action. This scene is obviously conveyed with a good deal of anthropomorphism. Even the word “own” smacks of human possession. And then there’s the sentimental mother raven’s death from “a broken heart.” Pathetic fallacy, anyone?\nYet I can’t help but recall a memory from my youth. Goose hunting one early morning on a reedy lake in Washington state (USA), I listened to a lone goose forlornly calling as he or she circled and circled round our boat. My father and I both surmised that the bird was calling for its missing mate, who likely had been shot down by some other hunter. Was that goose’s heart “broken”? Who can say? That it called and called, and that its vocalizations conveyed a sense of mournful loss—well, those were my burdensome impressions then (and, however sentimental and erroneous, no doubt later played a part in my becoming a vegetarian). Emotional suffering is not the sole domain of humankind.\nNow comes the transformation, perhaps along the lines of what Ashton Nichols heralds as “urbanature,” whereby nature is converted not into Hegelian-Emersonian culture but into that nature forged by human animals as another—“green” or not-so-green–portion of the world. Beavers use trees to make dams; humans use them to build houses and ships (and poems):\nThe boughs from the trunk the woodman did sever;\nAnd they floated it down on the course of the river.\nThey sawed it in planks, and its bark they did strip,\nAnd with this tree and others they made a good ship.\nNow for the ironic close, whereby human mastery is thwarted. Poetic justice or just bad luck? Or is this finale best read allegorically, for instance regarding late eighteenth-century British politics? Certainly the poem (composed circa 1798) alludes to many a past shipwreck, and also eerily foreshadows, at least to my eyes, the wreck of John Wordsworth’s ship in 1805:\nThe ship, it was launched; but in sight of the land\nSuch a storm there did rise as no ship would withstand.\nIt bulged on a rock, and the waves rush’d in fast;\nRound and round flew the Raven, and cawed to the blast.\nHe heard the last shriek of the perishing souls–\nSee! see! o’er the topmast the mad water rolls!\nRight glad was the Raven, and off he went fleet,\nAnd Death riding home on a cloud he did meet,\nAnd he thank’d him again and again for this treat:\nThey had taken his all, and REVENGE IT WAS SWEET\nAll the mariners drown in the shipwreck, and the ship itself vanishes beneath the waves. With this disaster comes the poem’s anthropomorphic, almost surreal, zinger: the raven feels “right glad” and indeed grateful for this shipwreck–so much so that he repeatedly thanks a home-bound, dwelling-aimed “Death” on his pale cloud. “They,” human landlubbers and mariners alike, “had taken his all,” his young ones and wife, and so “revenge” tasted “sweet.” A bird feel (and taste) revenge? Surely this point is where the poem slips off the rails of all verisimilitude, if it ever rode them at all. And of course all along the poem has operated as a fable with stock figures: “Woodman,” “Raven,” “Oak,” etc. Yet if Coleridge and Wordsworth could elsewhere ponder emotional-neuronal connections and correspondences between humans and animals (notably birds) regarding joy or happiness, why not less appealing emotions, as well? Who is to say that revenge has no animal analog or source? Outlandish as this fable becomes in terms of the distraught Raven’s tracking of the oak’s journey and material transformation, and of the bird’s own grief and anger—outlandish as these things are, they give me pause. For that out-land of distinction, of distance, is a “natural” separation we rely on very much: our difference from birds and all animals, even the most “intelligent” of animals. There’s much here to ponder, “though inland far we be.”\nLike Coleridge’s “Rime,” his “Raven” risks being too simply reduced to an eco-morality tale, where destructive human actions are justly decried. The poem soon becomes a plea for habitat preservation–or to be destroyed at our peril. But of course the poem doesn’t make this moral so easy, anymore than does “The Rime.” The bird does not quite exact his revenge (he doesn’t cause the storm), but he fully enjoys the ship’s and mariners’ destruction. Morality play then becomes revenge play. Revenge seems to be a feeling that is outlandishly our own: a form of feeling policed and cathartically controlled since at least Homer’s Iliad. Revenge is socially toxic, transforming men into beasts (of war), and it is thus also quintessentially “human.” Along with grief and sex, the feeling of vengeance is one of the key driving forces behind art—at least behind ancient-heroic art. In Coleridge’s forged fable vengeance is not like an animal emotion, it IS one. The fable arguably views all emotions as natural, with the difference between animal and human a matter more of degree than kind, however much we may prefer to see it differently. Our houses, our furniture and culture, come from other animals’ dwellings or dwelling places, as parts of a larger, global transformation not of nature into culture so much as of dwelling into dwelling, with a dash of the unheimlich, of an unhomely, uncanny sense of loss and lurking revenge, to discomfort us under our roofs and penthouse brows.

    "FilmQ03_Ch10: The Muslim World- Islamic Civilization Expands\nHow to Use Video as a Source\nStep #1: Familiarize yourself with film questions prior to viewing the film. By reading the questions and understanding the vocabulary contained within, you allow yourself the luxury of viewing the film without having to look at the questions continuously.\nStep #2: View and Listen Attentively. Unlike a book, a video provides information via visual images and audio. Both forms of data are ‘more valuable together’ than separately. For example, turn the volume off on your TV during your favorite program. Then, raise the volume while ‘blacking out’ the image. Under which conditions was the data most richly delivered? Always make sure that you have unobstructed viewing of a film and that the sound is audible.\nAs you view the video, pay attention to visual and/ or audio cues that reflect the issues raised by the questions below. Your responses should refer to video content as well as your current knowledge and understanding of history.\nStep #3: Organize Your Thoughts. Unlike a book, the data from a video is often delivered at a constant rate. With a book, you can slow your reading speed when you encounter a particular segment that is complicated. You can also turn back to a previous page to review information. A film is a bit different in that you may not always have the option to use ‘slow motion’ or ‘rewind’. Therefore, maintaining focus on the imagery and sound is important. Targeted Notes will reduce the amount of time you’re looking away from the screen. By writing quick and simple phrases of a few words each, you maintain greater attention to film events.\nTargeted notes use key words/ phrases that will ignite a thought or idea when you read them later. There is no concern for grammar or spelling while doing this. After the film has ended, you look at your targeted notes and manipulate the data to compile responses in complete sentences.\nOrganizational Tip: Vertically divide the sheet of paper where your responses will go. On the ‘left’ half, take targeted notes for each question given. After viewing the video, use the targeted notes to compose complete responses to each question (on the ‘right’ half of the sheet).\nWhen made available, contribute your response, comments, criticism, and questions (in complete sentences) to the class via the Verso application (rather than on paper). The goal is to have everyone contribute at least once in preparing a review sheet of this video. The content you share now will be required on future quizzes and exams.\nSOURCE: Millennium Video Series, The 11th Century: Century of the Sword, CNN Productions, Inc. 1999.

    "CANADA LYNX } Lynx canadensis\nDESCRIPTION: Canada lynx are medium-sized felines with long legs; large, furry paws; long, black ear tufts; and a short, black-tipped tail. Adult males usually weight about 22 pounds and reach about 34 feet in length; females are about 19 pounds and 32 inches long.\nHABITAT: In the contiguous United States, the lynx is associated with southern boreal forest — subalpine coniferous forest in the West and coniferous/deciduous forest in the East. Within these forest types, lynx are most likely to be found in areas with deep snow.\nRANGE: The contiguous U.S. distinct population segment of Canada lynx inhabits the forests of four regions: the Northeast, the Great Lakes, the northern Rocky Mountains/Cascades, and the southern Rocky Mountains. In the lower 48 states, the lynx resides in Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.\nMIGRATION: Documented lynx home ranges vary from eight to 700 square kilometers, with range size dependent upon the animal’s gender, the abundance of prey, the season, and the density of lynx populations.\nBREEDING: Mating occurs during February or March each year, with kittens — usually four — born 60 to 65 days later. Kittens are reared by the female and resemble those of the domestic cat.\nLIFE CYCLE: Female kits may breed for the first time as they approach one year of age, depending on food abundance and individual physical condition. The life span of both sexes usually falls between 10 and 20 years.\nFEEDING: The main prey animal of the Canada lynx is the snowshoe hare. Lynx will sometimes eat other small mammals and birds, particularly when hare populations decline.\nTHREATS: Major threats to the Canada lynx today are habitat destruction due to deforestation and fire suppression and trapping, as well as global warming. Snowmobiling in remaining lynx habitat is a serious and increasing threat, and the species is also hurt by expansion of the range of competing predators such as bobcats and coyotes.\nPOPULATION TREND: The Canada lynx’s complex life history and population dynamics — as well as a general lack of reliable data — make estimating the species’ population trend difficult, but it is known that the lynx occurs in drastically reduced numbers throughout its range.

Here's an explanation from Wikipedia \"The common British, Canadian, South African, and ANZAC tradition includes either one or two minutes of silence at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month (11:00 am, 11 November), as that marks the time (in the United Kingdom) when armistice became effective.\nThe Service of Remembrance in many Commonwealth countries generally includes the sounding of the \"Last Post\", followed by the period of silence, followed by the sounding of \"The Rouse\" (often mistakenly referred to as \"Reveille\"), and finished by a recitation of the \"Ode of Remembrance\". The \"Flowers of the Forest\", \"O Valiant Hearts\", \"I Vow to Thee, My Country\" and \"Jerusalem\" are often played during the service. Services also include wreaths laid to honour the fallen, a blessing, and national anthems. Mozambique does not observe the Remembrance Day.\"\nI felt it was only proper to salute our neighbors to the North as our friends and allies in the causes of freedom and liberty. May we always share this common bond that unites us. God bless Canada and those who, in her name, gave their lives in times of war, so that the many may live as free citizens.\nThe idea of Veterans Day came from an unlikely source - a shoe store owner in Emporia, Kansas. In 1953, shoe store owner Alfred King believed that November 11 should honor all veterans in the United States, not only those who served in World War I. Wikipedia picks up the story from there : \"King had been actively involved with the American War Dads during World War II. He began a campaign to turn Armistice Day into \"All\" Veterans Day. The Emporia Chamber of Commerce took up the cause after determining that 90% of Emporia merchants as well as the Board of Education supported closing their doors on November 11 to honor veterans. With the help of then-U.S. Rep. Ed Rees, also from Emporia, a bill for the holiday was pushed through Congress. President Dwight Eisenhower signed it into law on May 26, 1954.\"\nA lone voice in the Heartland of the United States was heard loud and clear in the Halls of Congress, and thanks to Alfred King, shoe store owner, we now celebrate the service to our country by roughly 25,000,000 veterans throughout the Fruited Plain each November 11.\nGod bless Alfred King, God bless our Veterans and God bless the United States of America.",
    "Animals seem to use migration to escape the spread of deadly pathogens...so it's bad news that many animals have stopped migrating.\nBillions of animals migrate across the world every year, with some taking months to get to their destination. Along the way, animals expose themselves to potentially deadly pathogens, encountering lots of different environments and making a few key stopover points that are shared by lots of different species. These areas can become hotbeds for disease. This mirrors how diseases spread in our modern civilization, as highly concentrated population centers can see massive outbreaks, and then a handful of people traveling elsewhere can take the disease with them.\nBut researchers at the University of Georgia have figured out the other side of migration, and why it actually can keep pathogens in check. Many parasites have transmission stages that require the host to stay in the same habitat. Speedy migration takes the infected host outside that habitat, effectively killing off the parasite before it has a chance to take hold. As a bonus, any parasites left behind in the now host-free habitat die off, cleaning up the entire area in time for the hosts' return from their travels.\nThere's also survival of the fittest at work here. It's pretty brutal stuff - migration forces the infected to take part in a long, strenuous activity that will either kill them or cure them. If, say, a sick bird can't make it through the day's long flight, it will peel off from the rest of the birds and die, sparing the rest of the flock from infection when they land for the night. And, again, there's a secondary effect at work here, as the dying hosts take the most serious strains of disease with them, leaving the surviving flock with the relatively mild pathogens. The migrating animals are essentially forcing evolution to work for them by promoting less virulent strains of disease.\nResearcher Sonia Altizer focused on monarch butterflies from eastern North America, which can migrate all the way from Canada to central Mexico. These butterflies migrate much farther distances than their monarch relatives elsewhere, and some populations in always pleasant areas like Florida and Hawaii don't bother with migration at all.\nAltizer and her colleagues found that infectious disease is lowest in the butterflies that travel the greatest distances, while the non-migratory monarchs are the most at risk of deadly pathogens. The parasite strains that did exist in the long-travelling butterflies were consistently weaker than their counterparts, all of which supports migration as a way of weeding out disease.\nBut monarch butterflies are just one of many species for which migration has become an endangered activity. Human activity has destroyed a lot of potential stopover sites and put up barriers like dams and fences that can block the way. This means once migratory animals are trapped in one habitat year-round, which places them at much greater risk of disease. Climate change is also a factor - the warmer it gets, the less likely animals are to bother to migrate to escape wintry conditions.\nAltizer's colleague Barbara Han sums up the danger:\n\"Migration is a strategy that has evolved over millions of years in response to selection pressures driven by resources, predators and lethal parasitic infections-any changes to this strategy could translate to changes in disease dynamics.\"\nThese findings speak to how complex and innovative evolution can be, as an incredibly energy-intensive activity like migration, something that requires sophisticated navigational skills, has risen as a way to protect species from disease. Now it's just a question of whether migration is a good enough strategy to survive this changing world - a lot of species are depending on it.\n[Read the full scientific article via Science]",

    "DENVER – Put on your poodle skirts and tune in Elvis on the transistor radio, because it’s starting to look a lot like the 1950s.\nUnfortunately, this won’t be the nostalgic ’50s of big cars and pop music.\nThe 1950s that could be on the way to Colorado is the decade of drought.\nSo says Brian Bledsoe, a Colorado Springs meteorologist who studies the history of ocean currents and uses what he learns to make long-term weather forecasts.\n“I think we’re reliving the ’50s, bottom line,” Bledsoe said Friday morning at the annual meeting of the Colorado Water Congress.\nBledsoe studies the famous El Niño and La Niña ocean currents. But he also looks at other, less well-known cycles, including long-term temperature cycles in the oceans.\nIn the 1950s, water in the Pacific Ocean was colder than normal, but it was warmer than usual in the Atlantic. That combination caused a drought in Colorado that was just as bad as the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.\nThe ocean currents slipped back into their 1950s pattern in the last five years, Bledsoe said. The cycles can last a decade or more, meaning bad news for farmers, ranchers, skiers and forest residents.\n“Drought feeds on drought. The longer it goes, the harder it is to break,” Bledsoe said.\nThe outlook is worst for Eastern Colorado, where Bledsoe grew up and his parents still own a ranch. They recently had to sell half their herd when their pasture couldn’t provide enough feed.\n“They’ve spent the last 15 years grooming that herd for organic beef stock,” he said.\nBledsoe looks for monsoon rains to return to the Four Corners and Western Slope in July. But there’s still a danger in the mountains in the summer.\n“Initially, dry lightning could be a concern, so obviously, the fire season is looking not so great right now,” he said.\nWeather data showed the last year’s conditions were extreme.\nNolan Doesken, Colorado’s state climatologist, said the summer of 2012 was the hottest on record in Colorado. And it was the fifth-driest winter since record-keeping began more than 100 years ago.\nDespite recent storms in the San Juan Mountains, this winter hasn’t been much better.\n“We’ve had a wimpy winter so far,” Doesken said. “The past week has been a good week for Colorado precipitation.”\nHowever, the next week’s forecast shows dryness returning to much of the state.\nReservoir levels are higher than they were in 2002 – the driest year since Coloradans started keeping track of moisture – but the state is entering 2013 with reservoirs that were depleted last year.\n“You don’t want to start a year at this level if you’re about to head into another drought,” Doesken said.\nIt was hard to find good news in Friday morning’s presentations, but Bledsoe is happy that technology helps forecasters understand the weather better than they did during past droughts. That allows people to plan for what’s on the way.\n“I’m a glass-half-full kind of guy,” he said.",
    "- THE MAGAZINE\n- INFO FOR...\n- ASI Store\n- ASI Top 25\n- Product & Literature Showcases\n- Services Marketplace\n- List Rental\n- Market Research\n- Custom Content & Marketing Services\nYou may already know something about the benefits of plasma treatment, such as higher treatment (dyne) levels, extended life of treatment over time, the lack of surface morphology degradation, and the elimination of pinholing and backside treatment.\nUntil recently, low-pressure vacuum plasmas have been used to treat two- and three-dimensional plastic objects and polymer films. The recent introduction of high-density atmospheric plasma for film, foil, paper, foam, nonwoven and woven substrate applications has had a significant impact on the surfaces of these materials at considerably lower capitalization costs.\nHigh-density atmospheric plasma represents a new generation of surface-treatment technology. It allows plasmas to be sustained at atmospheric pressure in a way that permits the surface treatment of polymers and other substrates. It can be configured to work with a variety of feeding systems, including continuous web.\nHow does Plasma Compare to Corona?Corona treatment is an electrical process that uses ionized air to increase the surface tension of non-porous substrates. Normally, corona-treating systems operate at an electrical voltage of approximately 10 kV.\nLike corona, plasma is the electrical ionization of a gas. The plasma (glow) discharge creates a smooth, undifferentiated cloud of ionized gas with no visible electrical filaments. However, unlike corona, plasma is created at much lower voltage levels and temperatures.\nPlasma Effects on Substrate SurfacesCorona converts the substrate surface from a non-polar state to a polar state. Oxygen molecules from the corona discharge area are then free to bond to the ends of the molecules in the substrate being treated, resulting in an increase in surface tension.\nThe same description holds true for atmospheric plasma, with a few exceptions. The rate at which electron bombardment occurs within a high-density atmospheric plasma is up to 100 times greater. This increased electron activity forces greater ion bombardment to the substrate surface. This results in increased etching, chain scission and crosslinking on the substrate's surface, which influences stronger bonding attributes across the surface of the web. Specifically, mechanical interlocking is enhanced, bonding materials together by allowing the adhesive or sealant to take advantage of the microscopic roughness etched to the surface by atmospheric plasma, locking them together. In addition, covalent chemical bonding is promoted, using mutually reactive chemical groups newly resident at the substrate surface (delivered by atmospheric plasma treatment) and the adhesive to form the strongest, most durable bond.\nSummarizing the treatment process, high-density atmospheric plasma employs chemical gases that produce controlled chemical reactions on the surface. Chemistry molecules that are introduced are propelled to the material surface. Low-molecular-weight material is cleaned from the surface and specific gas molecules covalently bond to the surface. This is how adhesion can be boosted between the adhesive and the material surface.\nAtmospheric plasma technology also eliminates the possibility of backside treatment. The high-speed photos capture the optical differences between corona and atmospheric plasma treatment. The corona image shows the expected \"filaments,\" while the plasma treatment generates a smooth treat pattern.\nBenefits of Atmospheric Plasma for Adhesive AdhesionPlasma treatment offers three key benefits that adhesive manufacturers can use to their advantage.\n1. Longer life treatments. Substrates that have been atmospheric plasma-treated hold their treatment levels longer than corona-treated surfaces. Longer treatment life allows product converters to take advantage of economies of scale during production, increase inventory life and provide enhanced manufacturing flexibility.\n2. Higher treat levels allow for treatment of difficult-to-treat surfaces. Atmospheric plasma treatment is a viable alternative for substrates for which corona treating is ineffective. For example, difficult-to-treat fluoropolymer-based materials like Teflon® do not respond to the corona process but do respond to atmospheric plasma treatment.\n3. Treatment of thicker substrates. While substrates that are thicker than 0.125\" usually do not respond well to the corona process, they can be treated by atmospheric plasma. Films, metallized films, foils, foams, wovens and nonwovens are all candidates for atmospheric plasma surface treatment.\nAn atmospheric plasma treatment system called Plasma3™ that can operate at low temperature to provide the advantages plasma technology has over existing surface-treatment technologies has been developed by Enercon Industries. The surface energies of materials treated by this system have been shown to increase substantially, thereby significantly enhancing the wettability, printability and adhesive/ink/coating adhesion properties of these materials.\nWeb-Based Atmospheric Plasma Market ApplicationsWater- and solventborne, alcohol-based, and cold-seal adhesives are used for a variety of laminating applications. They are used by contract laminators and consumer products companies to bond multiple combinations of film, fiberglass, foam, fabric, paper, nonwovens, and rubber. The laminates are used to produce a range of products, including the following.\n- Packaging applications - sealing tapes, weather-strip, labels\n- Automotive applications - seals, gaskets, headliners, trim\n- Textile applications - protective apparel, outerwear\n- Medical applications - medical drapes and garments, bandages, electrodes, labeling, lidding, covers\n- Electronic applications\n- Bonding/assembly and thermal management tapes\nThe system also has the flexibility to be operated with variable chemistries and without the generation of ozone, pin-holing, and backside treatment.\nFor more information, contact Rory Wolf at email@example.com.",
    "Advanced CT scans and wax modeling have revealed the face of King Richard III\nShowing a hint of a smile, a prominent chin, and slightly arched nose, the facial reconstruction is based on a skull found along with other bones just 2 feet beneath a car park in Leicester, UK, last September.\nThe reconstruction follows confirmation that the skeleton was that of the king killed in battle more than 500 years ago.\nAccording to Richard Buckley, the lead archaeologist on the project at the University of Leicester, DNA tests had proved “beyond reasonable doubt” that the bones were those of the last Plantagenet king.\nThe model was created by digitizing a three-dimensional image of the complete skull and using the bone structure to estimate the thickness of the various layers of muscle and skin.\n“When the 3D digital bust was complete it was replicated in plastic using a rapid prototyping system,” Caroline Wilkinson, professor of craniofacial identification at Dundee University, UK, said.\nThe head was painted and textured with prosthetic eyes. Using portraits as reference, the researchers created a realistic and royal appearance by dressing the king with a wig, hat and clothing.\nAccording to historian John Ashdown-Hill, the model is so lifelike that it is “almost like being face to face with a real person.”\nAlthough the essential features of Richard are quite similar to those shown in various depictions of the king, of whom no contemporary portraits exist, the model reveals a more pleasant and younger face.\nIndeed, many of the later portraits of Richard showed him with a rather mean face — quite appropriate for the bloodthirsty usurper depicted by Shakespeare.\n“It doesn’t look like the face of a tyrant… He’s very handsome. It’s like you could just talk to him, have a conversation with him right now,” Philippa Langley, a member of the Richard III Society who instigated the search for the skeleton, told Channel 4′s documentary “King in a Car Park.”\nRichard III was killed in 1485 in the Battle of Bosworth, which was the last act of the decades-long fight over the throne known as War of the Roses. The king was defeated by Henry Tudor, who became King Henry VII.\nExaminations of the skeleton revealed that Richard III was 5 feet, 8 inches tall and had a slender, almost feminine physique.\nHe suffered from scoliosis, a severe curvature of the spine, in line with the hunchback king described by Shakespeare.\nThe skeleton of England’s last medieval king may be reburied in Leicester Cathedral, which is a just short distance away from the car park where it was found.\nThe Cathedral is expected to approve the re-interring request later this year.\nImages: The reconstructed face.

    "Cooperate with a school far away and measure the size of our planet! The method is the same as that used in Egypt almost 2500 years ago. The observations can be done outdoor, or indoor if the Sun is shining into a class room.\nIn this exercise you have to register. Then, you need to select another school to cooperate with. This school should be as far away from you (to the south or to the north) as possible.\nThe classes (or even whole schools if the schools choose to do this together) must then agree on a date to make the exercise. It must be done at a very specific time on that date (read more below).\nFind an even area where you can see the Sun. Use the spirit level to check that the area is absolutely in level.\nPut one end of the pipe on the ground and lift the other end towards the Sun. Avoid looking at the Sun! You will see a shadow on the ground cast by the pipe. Try to make the shadow as small as possible. When it is completely gone, the sunlight penetrates the pipe.\nWhen the sunlight reaches the ground through the pipe, you must keep the pipe absolutely steady. Use the square to measure the angle between the pipe and the ground. When the Sun is exactly in the south (the time for this you or your teacher has already found), you read the angle and make a record of it. Be as accurate as possible!!\nYou should practice how to set up the experiment and how to read the angle before the day you have agreed on. This is important so that you are able to read the angle accurately on exactly the right time. During the exercise the weather must be good enough that the Sun is visible on both locations.\nHow can we use these observations to caclulate the circumference of the Earth?\nWhen we know the distance d between to schools - situated at approximately the same longitude - and angle C, we may calculate the circumference o of the Earth: The ratio of d and the angle C is equal to the ratio between the cicumference o of the Earth and the 360 degrees of a full circle:\nIt is not always that easy to find a school that is situated due North of South. We must there adopt the method a little by claiming that d is the distance between the latitudes of the schools. d can be calculated in this webpage. Please make sure that you use the same longitude for the schools.\nThen we only need angle C. But that is just what the observations from the different locations give us.\nThen you will find the circumference of the Earth using this expression:\nWhat is the size of our planet? In order to answer that question one must know that the Earth is a globe (almost spherical). During a total eclipse of the Moon this is evident. Before and after the total phase, the edge of the shadow of the Earth is seen - it is circular!\nThe size of the Earth was determined already more than 2000 years ago. This is quite impressive, but was due to a clever observation. The director of the famous library in Alexandria in Egypt, the geographer Eratosthenes (about 276-195 BC.) did the historic achievement.\nEratosthenes had learned a fascinating fact about the city of Syene in southern Egypt, not far from Aswan: When the Sun was at its highest in the sky in this city on the longest day of the year (today we call it summer solstice), the Sun did not cast any shadows. Actually, the Sun shined into deep wells. The story says that nobody dared to stare into the wells since they could become blinded by the intense light reflected by the water deep down.\nIn Syene the Sun therefore had to be in the zenith at this time. In Alexandria, further north in Egypt, Eratosthenes knew from his own experience that the shadows at the same time was equivalent to the Sun being one 50th of a circle away from zenith.\nThe distance from Syene to Alexandria had to be one 50th of the circumference of the Earth.\nHe could not measure the distance between the cities directly, but estimates of people travelling between the cities and the time they spent, gave a distance of about 5000 stadions. The circumference of the Earth therefore had to be 250 000 stadions, and the diameter about one third of this.\nToday we don't know the exact length one one stadion, but many sources claim that 250 000 stadions correspond to 39 900 kilometers. This would be astoundingly close to the correct value which is 40 074 kilometers!\nAnyway, the method is correct and can be applied even today to estimate the size of our Earth.\nExercise 2: Measure the distance to the the Sun\n- Method A: Timing Venus' entrance and departure on solar disc\n- Method B: Drawing Venus' path across the solar disc\nOn www.astroevents.no there is more information about the Transit of Venus and other celestial events.",
    "Types of Valve Disease\nHeart valves can have one of two malfunctions:\nRegurgitation (or leakage of the valve)\nThe valve(s) does not close completely, causing the blood to flow backward through the valve. This results in leakage of the blood back into the atria from the ventricles (in the case of the mitral and tricuspid valves) or leakage of blood back into the ventricles (in the case of the aortic and pulmonary valves).\nStenosis (or narrowing of the valve)\nThe valve(s) opening becomes narrowed or valves become damaged or scarred (stiff), inhibiting the flow of blood out of the ventricles or atria. The heart is forced to pump blood with increased force in order to move blood through the narrowed or stiff (stenotic) valve(s).\nHeart valves can have both malfunctions at the same time (regurgitation and stenosis). Also, more than one heart valve can be affected at the same time. When heart valves fail to open and close properly, the implications for the heart can be serious, possibly hampering the heart's ability to pump blood adequately through the body. Heart valve problems are one cause of heart failure.",
    "Tim the Plumber wrote:\nThe idea that you can predict the climate based on it's temperature behaviour between 1970 and 1998 is silly. Just as the statement that the absence of warming since 1998 and 2011 cannot utterly disproove AGW the rise between 1970 and 1998 cannot 100% proove the theory that CO2 is a significant greenhouse gas at the levels we have today.\nNobody is trying to predict temperatures based on historically temperatures over the last 40 or so. The predictions are based on our understanding of earth's climate over hundreds of millions of years and particularly the last 4 million years of recurring ice ages. The climate while complicated has to obey some very simple basic physical rules that is the energy coming in has over time to equal the energy going out. Change that simple relationship in some way and the temperature will change change until such time as the equation is back in balance. It is certain that greenhouse gases reduce the amount of energy that leaves the earth.\nNorthern Europe is having a wet and cool summer, it's just America which is having a long, hot and dry one.\nNo my original statement is correct\nAccording to NOAA:-http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2012/6\nThe Northern Hemisphere land and ocean average surface temperature for June 2012 was the all-time warmest June on record, at 1.30°C (2.34°F) above average.\nThe Northern Hemisphere average land temperature, where the majority of Earth's land is located, was record warmest for June. This makes three months in a row — April, May, and June — in which record-high monthly land temperature records were set. Most areas experienced much higher-than-average monthly temperatures, including most of North America and Eurasia, and northern Africa. Only northern and western Europe, and the northwestern United States were notably cooler than average.\nTim the Plumber wrote:\nWhen thinking about such climatic events it is vital to have a sense of proportion and not see a tiny change over 3 decades as a reason to think that there will be a drastic \"exponential\" continuation of this.\nThe temperatures changes over the last 3 decades simply confirms our basic understanding of the climate.\nIt is akin to having a graph of the speed of your car traveling along a highway. When the speed is 55mph your pasenger is happy, when the graph plots up to 57 mph the pasenger panics because the car is about to accelerate untill the machine disintergrates at the sound barrier. When the graph shows a slowing to 53mph the panic is of the sudden stopping of the car and the trafic behind slamming into the back of the car.\nNo it is more being in a car where the cruise control is stuck and the speed just keeps increasing.\nClimate varies about quiote a lot.\nBecause we live fairly short lives we do not rember the droughts of the dust bowl. We do not rember the medevil warm period. We do not rember the frost fairs on the frozen Thames.\nThis is why we maintain weather data which shows that the current conditions are both worst and different.\nWe should take these dire warnings with a big pinch of salt.\nDire warnings should be assessed on the merits and action taken if necessary but never ignored\nThe sea level rose by 18cm last centuary, how many cities flooded because of this? This centuary looks like it could be twice as bad, maybe.\nSo as long as we split the sea level rises into 18 cm chunks it will be no problem?\nI am reminded of camels transporting straw.",
    "The euthanasia rate for stray and abandoned cats and dogs that are taken to New York City’s animal shelters has steadily fallen to a projected 38 percent for 2008, down from 74 percent in 2002, giving advocates for animals hope that they will be able to meet an announced goal of bringing the rate to zero by 2015.\nThe Mayor’s Alliance for NYC’s Animals, a nonprofit coalition of about 140 animal shelters and rescue groups, was founded in 2002. In 2005, it announced the goal of making New York City a “no kill” community by 2015. Experts say that San Francisco is the largest United States city with a “no kill” policy for cats and dogs, but the city has only 9 percent of New York City’s population, so the scale of the New York effort is considerably more ambitious.\nThe problem of homeless cats and dogs remains serious, officials say. About 43,000 cats and dogs were taken in by the city’s animal shelters in 2008, a figure that has barely budged from the 46,187 recorded in 2003.\nThe goal of the alliance is to eventually eliminate the need to kill any “dog or cat of reasonable health or temperament” merely because the animal does not have a home.\nAmong the steps being taken to reduce the need for euthanasia are more aggressive neutering and spaying of animals, thus reducing the number of births; increasing the transfer of animals to alternative shelters and rescue groups, thus increasing the chances of adoption; offering $25 microchip implanting for pets, speeding the return of lost dogs and cats to their owners; improving adoption outreach and in some cases providing adoption subsidies; and providing free spaying and neutering services for pets whose owners have cards for Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for poor and disabled people.\nIn addition, the city has a Feral Cat Initiative that has financed so-called trap-neuter-return programs since 2006.\nFrom 74 percent in 2002, the euthanasia rate dropped to 69 percent in 2003, 59 percent in 2004, 53 percent in 2005, 47 percent in 2006, 43 percent in 2007 and a projected 38 percent in 2008.\n“We have a long way to go, but we’re definitely making progress toward our goal,” says Jane Hoffman, president of the alliance. “The current economic downturn puts additional pressure on our facilities, but we’re determined to become a no-kill community and the alliance has realized some impressive achievements along the way.”\nNonetheless, the number of dogs and cats coming into the city’s shelter system — which is managed by a private nonprofit group, Animal Care and Control — has remained fairly constant, at around 43,000. More than twice as many cats as dogs come into the shelters each year, and more than twice as many cats as dogs are killed each year.\nAn independent expert said that New York City’s goal of becoming a no-kill community was laudable, but might be difficult to achieve.\n“No-kill is a model, an aspirational goal,” said the expert, Dr. Michael R. Moyer, who is the Rosenthal director of shelter animal medicine at University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. “I don’t think it should be dismissed out of hand, but it takes a lot of coordination, orchestration and resources.”\nThere are a “formidable set of challenges” involved in eliminating the need for euthanasia, Dr. Moyer said, adding that animal population control problems result from human and social problems.\nAnimals end up in shelters after they are brought in by residents or animal control officers, or voluntarily surrendered by their owners.\nCats are a particular challenge, he said, because “feral cats that are poorly socialized and have never been raised with people” are generally not adoptable as pets.\nNearly half of all cats come from neighbors, and spaying and neutering are not as widespread as they should be, he added.\nCats also are far more likely than dogs to live in the wild in packs, Dr. Moyer said. They are also more elusive than dogs, he said, more adaptable, capable of living in a fairly tiny habitat and better able to live in difficult underground environments like sewers.",

    "Our History and Heritage\nWhat started as a cartoonist’s dream has turned into the largest grassroots conservation organization in the country. Today the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) boasts over 4 million supporters and 47 state affiliates. NWF continues to be the voice of conservation for diverse constituencies that include hunters, anglers, gardeners, bird watchers, scientists, outdoor enthusiasts, and families raising the next generation of habitat stewards.\nFrom climate change to mining reform, from wilderness to energy development, from backyard habitats to connecting people to nature, NWF has the professional expertise and grassroots power to make a difference for wildlife and our children’s future. All of this didn’t happen by chance, however, and understanding our past will propel us into the future.\nThe Early Years\nTo understand NWF’s beginning, we must look back to the roots of conservation in this country. American wildlife conservation is grounded in the belief that wildlife belongs to the people, a concept commonly known as the Public Trust Doctrine or the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation.\nThe Public Trust Doctrine was formally established during an 1872 Supreme Court Case, Martin vs. Wadell. A private landowner, Martin claimed to own both the land alongside and underneath New Jersey’s Raritan River, tracing his title to a grant from King Charles to the Duke of York in 1664 which purported to convey, \"all the lands, islands, soils, rivers, harbors, mines, minerals, quarries, woods, marshes, waters, lakes, fishings, hawkings, and fowlings.\"\nMartin claimed that the oystermen, Wadell, owed him for the taking of oysters. In his ruling Chief Justice Robert Taney stated, \"[w]hen the people of New Jersey took possession of the reins of government, and took into their own hands the powers of sovereignty, the prerogatives and regalities which before belonged to either the crown or the parliament, became immediately and rightly vested in the state.\"\nWildlife now belonged to the people but conservation was not yet part of America’s fabric. In the late 19th century on the heels of the Industrial Revolution, market killing of the buffalo, waterfowl, and other wild game species began decimating America’s wildlife to support the growing work force and urban appetites. In response, dedicated hunters and anglers from New York to Montana pushed for the nation’s first game laws, restricting the numbers and methods of take for wildlife.\nWith laws established to sustain healthy wildlife populations, conservation minded leaders emerged to challenge the values by which American’s perceived wildlife.\nAfter the assassination of President McKinley in 1901, the great hunter and outdoorsman, Theodore Roosevelt, moved into to the White House and the bully pulpit. Roosevelt’s conservation ethic was formed through the eyes of the hunter during trips west to South Dakota and Montana.\nIn his own words: “Above all, we should realize that the effort toward this end is essentially a democratic movement. It is...in our power...to preserve large tracts of wilderness...and to preserve the game...for the benefit all lovers of nature, and to give reasonable opportunities for the exercise of the skill of the hunter, whether he is or is not a man of means.”\nAnd later: “It is foolish to regard proper game laws as undemocratic. On the contrary, they are essentially in the interests of the people as a whole, because it is only through their enactment and enforcement that the people can preserve the game and prevent its becoming purely the property of the rich. The man of small means is dependent solely upon wise and well-executed game laws for his enjoyment of the sturdy pleasure of the chase.”\nTheodore Roosevelt wasn’t all talk, however. He acted on his convictions and before he ended his term as president in 1909, he endowed the United States with 230 million acres of protected landscapes for the conservation of wildlife—approximately 84,000 acres for every day he was in office. With Americans and legislators beginning to embrace the concepts of conservation as a core, fundamental value, the first National Wildlife Refuge, National Forests, National Monuments, and Game Preserves were created.",

    "Is there zero chance to reach zero waste?\nTerraCycle loves to find recycling opportunities in strange places, and we’ve been largely consumer-facing since we launched the Drink Pouch Brigade with Capri Sun and Honest Kids in 2007. Our business-to-consumer programs have been successful for such varied groups (including schools, churches, offices, and even individuals) that we didn’t start delving into business-to-business programs until last year.\nWe launched a program with Kimberly Clark Professional to collect their cleanroom garments as well as hoods, boots, and slippers. We’ve recently introduced a pilot program to collect nitrile gloves, and have been testing those collections at one of the collecting locations at Life Technologies. With the recent success of this program and pilot program, it dawned on me that while TerraCycle has always talked about and publicized consumer facing programs and consumer facing recycling, there is opportunity for an even larger recycling impact with business to business programs.\nThe waste produced by billion dollar manufacturing and research industries dwarfs the amount of waste produced in a small neighborhood. According to the Gasification Technologies Council, American manufacturers produce 7.6 billion tons of industrial in just one year. Construction, road projects, housing projects and the like aren’t even included in that number; those activities produce 136 million tons in one year.\nCompanies such as Subaru have already instituted effective zero-waste programs; their Indiana manufacturing plant diverts more than 90 percent of waste produced. They partner with other companies to take away the waste produced from their business, such as paint sludge, which is dried into a powder and then mixed into compounds that make guardrail blocks and parking lot bumpers.\nThe chemicals that come out of those factories seem to me to be more harmful than the food packaging that is coming out of individual homes. Both are incredibly important, but considering the lack of movement in business to business recycling so far, the potential is huge. The question for those of us in the packaging industry is where can we make these business-to-business programs work in packaging?\nI think there are a variety of places we can look here. If a piece of packaging can be made from another’s waste, there is no excuse for us to not be using it. If there’s a byproduct from packaging that we produce that can be towards what another manufacturer needs, we should be setting up a system to harness what could be potentially useful. Recycling in the packaging world isn’t just about what consumers do with the packaging when they’ve finished sipping their juice or eating their chips, and it’s not just about where we get the materials to make the packaging (new or recycled). It’s also about the other details, and the recycling we can do where people least expect it.",
    "Before a photovoltaic installation may be constructed, engineers calculate, for some selected days in the year, when and where the interfering light reflections occur, especially if airports, highways or larger residential areas are close by. In the future, this will be easier and more comprehensive: with software that creates a three-dimensional depiction of the glare at the touch of a button.\nThe pilot is about to land the plane, when he is suddenly blinded by glaring brightness created by a large-scale photovoltaic installation reflecting the sun. These blinding events create major safety hazards in the vicinity of airports. They also increase the potential for accidents when near highways. For this reason, before a photovoltaic installation may be constructed, engineers calculate, for some selected days in the year, when and where the interfering light reflections occur, especially if airports, highways or larger residential areas are close by.\nIn the future, this will be easier and more comprehensive: with software that creates a three-dimensional depiction of the glare at the touch of a button. It is developed by researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT in Sankt Augustin, Germany together with their colleagues from the State Office for the Environment, Protection of Nature and Geology in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and various solar planners. \"The software creates a 3D view from all sides for any time of the day or time of the year,\" says Alexander Wollert, a scientist at the FIT. \"We recreate the entire scene in a three-dimensional room, with a map, elevation profile, sun, three-dimensional buildings and photovoltaic installations.\" The researchers also simulate the course of the sun and the blinding for each time unit and in any direction. They take into account the elevation of various ground surfaces as well as obstacles, such as trees or noise barrier walls.\nThe planners can randomly move the installation around the monitor screen and immediately determine when and where it will cause problems. They determine at what position of the sun, at what time of the day and during which season the solar modules cause glares, and in which directions the reflections point. For example, do they affect residents, how often and how intense? And what can be done to prevent glares? For example, the planners of the installation can change the orientation and tilt angle of the elements. If that is not enough to mitigate the effects, the software can \"simulate\" modules with a somewhat more matte surface. They reflect the sun far less than traditional models; however, they are also more expensive.\nThe researchers have set up and tested the software for the region around the Frankfurt airport. Building on that, they are now developing a version that is intended to help the operators of photovoltaic installations throughout Germany. \"The software downloads its map material dynamically from the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy,\" explains Wollert. \"It automatically downloads the required map material from there, as well as analogous contour maps. The software combines this information into a three-dimensional view of the respective surroundings, which form the basis for all further calculations.\" Wollert expects the software to be operational in the coming year.\nThe application is also of interest for private installations, because sometimes lawsuits are filed when neighbors feel bothered by the glare. In the future, the software could help avoid this problem. Used as service for engineers or planning agencies the peace among neighbors could be preserved.\nExplore further: Cape Wind gets $200M investment from Danish fund",

    "Charles Heywood kept his cannon firing even as his ship sank.\nBorn in Waterville on Oct. 3, 1839, Heywood was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps at New York City on April 5, 1858. Thirty-five months later he reported aboard the USS Cumberland, a 24-gun sloop of war then assigned to the Gosport Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Va.\nFearing the shipyard’s capture by Confederate militia, senior Navy officers ordered Gosport abandoned on April 20, 1861. After mining key installations with barrels of gunpowder, Heywood and his Marines lit the fuses and hastened aboard the USS Cumberland, already slipping seaward on the ebbing Elizabeth River.\nThe resulting explosions and fires caused significant damage, but Confederate engineers quickly repaired crucial machinery. They also raised the burned and scuttled USS Merrimac. Upon its hull arose an ironclad, the CSS Virginia. Measuring 263 feet in length and weighing 3,200 tons, the steam-engine ironclad mounted 10 massive cannons. The skipper was Capt. Franklin Buchanan.\nHe intended to sail into Hampton Roads and sink the Yankee warships stationed there. By the time Buchanan ordered his ship to sail on March 8, 1862, Heywood was a captain commanding the USS Cumberland’s Marine contingent.\nBrilliant late-winter sunshine and warm air engulfed Hampton Roads as the CSS Virginia stood downriver that Saturday. Buchanan had already selected his first target. “I am going to ram the Cumberland,” which was equipped with “the new rifled guns, the only ones in their whole fleet we have cause to fear,” he told Chief Engineer H. Ashton Ramsay. “The moment we are out in the Roads, I’m going to make right for her and ram her.”\nThat morning, the USS Cumberland lay moored some 300 yards off Newport News on the north shore of Hampton Roads. Aboard the Cumberland, Cmdr. William Radford had gone ashore, leaving Lt. George Morris, the executive officer, in command.\nAt noon, sailors on watch aboard the Cumberland “discovered three vessels under steam, standing down the Elizabeth River toward Sewell’s Point,” Morris wrote on March 9. One ship belched black smoke; Morris, Heywood, and other USS Cumberland officers could see the smoke without using their spyglasses.\nBuchanan’s underpowered ironclad steamed ponderously into Hampton Roads. After the CSS Virginia cleared Sewell’s Point about 1:30 p.m., Buchanan steered west to attack the USS Cumberland.\nAboard that ship, crewmen had already “double breeched the guns on the main deck, and cleared [the] ship for action,” Morris reported. He ordered the sloop pivoted on her anchor so that her starboard broadside would face the ironclad.\nAssigned to his ship’s after gun division, Heywood stood with his gun crews and watched as the Virginia approached. At 2 p.m. aboard the ironclad, Lt. Charles Simms fired the bow pivot gun, a 7-inch Brooke rifle.\nAccording to William C. Davis writing in “Duel Between the First Ironclads,” Simms’ cannon ball “screamed across the Roads and hit” the USS Cumberland “squarely, passing through the starboard-quarter rail” and hurling wood splinters into nearby Marines. After a Cumberland gun crew fired their ship’s forward 10-inch pivot gun and missed, Simms’ second shot exploded amidst that gun crew and killed all but two men.\n“Our firing became at once very rapid from the few guns we could bring to bear” as the ironclad “approached slowly,” recalled Master Moses Stuyvesant, who commanded the sloop’s after gun division. Simms’ pivot gun pounded the Cumberland; as shell fragments and wood splinters struck down sailors and Marines alike, Heywood’s crews fired their cannons through the dense smoke.\nAt approximately 2:30 p.m., Cumberland pilot A.B. Smith thought the approaching ironclad resembled “a huge half-submerged crocodile” with its “iron ram projecting, straight forward.”\nSteaming at 6 knots, the Virginia “stood on and struck us under the starboard fore channels” near the Cumberland’s bow, Morris reported. “She delivered her fire at the same time; the destruction was great. We returned the fire with solid shot with alacrity.”\nThe ironclad’s ram opened a hole about 7 feet across. Flooding with seawater, the USS Cumberland listed to starboard — and the ship’s weight bore the Virginia downward.\nThe ironclad was already reversing its engines as the tide pivoted the trapped Virginia alongside the sinking Cumberland. Then the ram broke off, freeing the ironclad from a potential watery grave. Buchanan backed his ship until it lay parallel to the Cumberland and only 20 feet away.\nCannons flashed and boomed for some 30 minutes as Heywood and his comrades heroically fought the Virginia amidst “a scene of carnage and destruction never to be recalled without horror,” Stuyvesant remembered. Blood and gore splattered across the main deck as Heywood shouted at sailors and Marines to drag wounded comrades to the ship’s port side.\nNow the sea lapped at the Cumberland’s main deck as the bowsprit disappeared into Hampton Roads. Gun crews kept firing until their cannons submerged. Stationed near the stern, Heywood worked his guns even as another cannon broke loose and lurched across the deck to crush a sailor.\n“At 3:35 [p.m.] the water had risen to the main hatchway, and the ship canted to port, and we delivered a parting fire, each man trying to save himself by jumping overboard,” Morris recalled. Acknowledging that severely wounded men taken below decks could only be left to drown, he credited specific officers for their coolness under fire.\n“I can only say in conclusion that all did their duty and we sunk with the American flag at the [mast] peak,” Morris closed his report.\nEven as the Cumberland’s deck sharply canted, Heywood remained with the aft guns. “The water began to swash over the upper deck, and still every unencumbered gun was hurling defiance at the foe,” wrote John S.C. Abbott in “The History of the Civil War in America, Vol. 1,” published in 1863.\n“The ship careened upon one side. The last gunner [Heywood], knee-deep in water, pulled the trigger of the last gun,” Abbott wrote. Then “the majestic frigate, with all her dead and all her wounded, sank like lead.”\nAnd Charles Heywood went overboard into Marine Corps lore.\nHis heroism went noticed. “I omitted to mention to you the gallant conduct of Lieutenant Charles Heywood … whose bravery upon the occasion of the fight with the Merrimack won my highest applause,” Morris wrote Navy Secretary Gideon Welles on April 12.\nHeywood received a brevet promotion to major after the battle. Of the 46 Marines aboard the USS Cumberland, 14 died. Another 107 sailors were killed aboard the sloop on March 8.\nThe next day, the Monitor fought the Virginia in Hampton Roads in history’s first ironclad-to-ironclad sea battle. Most history books still call the Virginia the “Merrimac.”\nHeywood would fight during another famous Civil War battle; he was commanding two gun crews aboard the USS Hartford at Mobile Bay, Ala. as Adm. David Farragut roared, “Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!” on Aug. 5, 1864. Within an hour, Heywood and Farragut traded shot and shell with another Confederate ironclad, the CSS Tennessee — commanded by Adm. Franklin Buchanan.\nThis time Buchanan lost and Heywood won.\nNamed the ninth Marine Corps commandant on Jan. 30, 1891, Charles Heywood instituted important changes to the corps’ mission and strength. Promoted to major general a year before his 1903 retirement, he died at Washington, D.C., on Feb. 26, 1915. His wife, Caroline Bacon, outlived him by 12 years.\nHeywood lies buried in Section 2, Lot 1115 at Arlington National Cemetery.\nBrian Swartz is the BDN special sections editor.

    "Bob Seay of WGBH News and James David Jacobs of Classical New England consider the odd history and captivating power of Aaron Copland's Lincoln Portrait.\nTo hear a performance of Lincoln Portrait with the United States Marine Band, conductor Col. Michael J. Colburn, and narrator Brian Stokes Mitchell, click on \"Listen\" above.\n|Abraham Lincoln, by Alexander Gardner [public domain], via Wikimedia Commons|\nWritten in 1942, Lincoln Portrait, by Aaron Copland, is a rare musical tribute to an American President. It played an inspirational role when it was written, during the dark, early days of World War II.\nBut it continued to inspire over the decades, with countless notable narrators giving voice to the words by Abraham Lincoln that Copland chose for his tribute.\nThose words, though, were chosen from within a surprising cultural context, as Bob Seay explains:\nIf Lincoln's words express the highest ideals of American democracy, Copland's music expresses the diversity of sources that have combined to create an American music and culture, as James David Jacobs writes:\n|Aaron Copland (source: AP)|\nIt’s hard in 2012 to appreciate just how original Copland’s Lincoln Portrait was in 1942. There had been other works that combined spoken text with orchestra, but the combination of serious public statement and serious artistic statement, with ceremony, history, and politics coexisting with music, was, and remains, rare.\nThe music Copland wrote isn’t mere backdrop for the words, the narrator not even speaking until the piece is about half over. That music tells a story, a story of both an individual life and of a nation. It’s also a story of diverse musical influences, reflecting the diverse musical strands that have come together to create an American music.\nThe beginning of the work is typical Copland, with woodwinds uttering soft three-note mottoes in intervals of fourths and fifths. That serenity, however, is answered by unsettling chords. It’s not unlike Ives’s The Unanswered Question and its dialogue between a stark, angular statement and its muddled response.\nThere are also subtle references to the music of Native Americans, engaged in what could be considered Lincoln’s other, less celebrated civil war. The dance-like tone of this section can be considered a sort of analogue to the scherzo in Beethoven’s Eroica symphony, representing both the joys and adventures of the individual heroic figure and the energy and the spirit of the nation and its people.\nThe strands come together, and the music reverts to the unsettled atmosphere of the work’s beginning. Then, just as we’ve almost forgotten about the speaker, he or she begins to speak.\nIt’s too important, Copland seems to be saying, to hide behind the cloak of artistic license, of interpretation and ambiguity. No, the meaning of this music must be spelled out, and when we hear the words of Lincoln we know why.\nCopland has done us a service by providing a frame in which we can ponder these words, which turn out to be as relevant to today’s struggles as they were in the 1860s. The questions posed by the cultural conflicts illustrated in the differing strands of music are still being asked today.\nLincoln and Copland seem to have some things in common. Both pulled off radical, even revolutionary accomplishments while being regarded as accessible and populist. Both took the ideas of acknowledged radicals and made them palatable for a general audience. Both took their roles in the mainstream as serious, important missions, aimed at bringing wildly divergent philosophical camps together. And both were criticized by those selfsame radicals and branded as sellouts or traitors.\nBeyond all that, they occupy similar places in our culture: the historical significance of each has been subject to regular cycles of reassessment, a process that began during each man’s own lifetime. Lincoln Portrait gives us the chance to consider them together, with all the resonance each man’s life and work have for us today.\n- James David Jacobs\nREAD MORE AND HEAR LINCOLN PORTRAIT ON-DEMAND\nComment on This Article\nNews updates from WGBH",
    "Speech-language pathologists use the PCC -- percent consonants correct -- to determine what speech sounds a client is unable to produce. This measurement also helps the speech-language pathologist determine the severity of a client's speech disorder. PCC helps decide if a client is appropriate for speech therapy, as well as determine therapy goals. For a speech-language pathologist to accurately calculate PCC, a client must be able to produce multiple words for a lengthy speech sample.\nThings You'll Need\n- Digital voice recorder\nRecord with a digital voice recorder a communication sample of at least 100 words from the client. Use toys or pictures to elicit language from younger children. For older children or adults, ask open-ended questions or ask the client to describe an event or experience.\nTranscribe the speech sample phonetically by hand or on a computer. Clearly indicate when the client produces consonants in error by highlighting incorrect pronunciations in a different color or using a specific symbol to denote errors.\nAdd up the total number of consonants and the total number of correct consonants. Divide the number of correct consonants by the total number of consonants. Multiply the answer by 100 to determine the PCC.\nUse the PCC to determine the severity of the speech disorder. A percentage of 85 to 100 indicates a mild disorder; 65 to 85 percent, mild-moderate; 50 to 65 percent, moderate-severe; and below 50 percent, severe.\n- Photo Credit George Doyle/Stockbyte/Getty Images George Doyle/Valueline/Getty Images BananaStock/BananaStock/Getty Images",
    "Poor farmers are most vulnerable to climate change\n“We used to harvest hundreds of maize sacks, but due to rain scarcity we plant much and end up harvesting almost nothing,” says Dickson Mnyukwa from Chibelela village in Tanzania’s Dodoma district. He supports a family of eight on crops watered only by what falls from the sky. In recent years, he has seen his crops fail repeatedly.\nAgriculture is crucial throughout Tanzania and Malawi – for employment, export revenue and food security. As in other parts of Africa, droughts are becoming more frequent and more severe. Both countries depend heavily on rain-fed agriculture, leaving them highly vulnerable to climate extremes and variation.\nEven as they face increasingly unreliable growing seasons, farmers in both countries lack access to modern farming methods. They have limited financial means and poor infrastructure. And their success – or lack of it – has nationwide implications for income and food security. Poor communities are particularly vulnerable.\nAdapting to uncertainty demands innovation\nWith climate change, and unchanged farming methods, crop yields are likely to fall. The Institute of Resource Assessment at Tanzania’s University of Dar es Salaam is leading participatory action research to test innovative farming methods to protect rural livelihoods and strengthen agricultural systems. Using trial plots, farmers are testing approaches to the range of possible conditions they may face from season to season. But farmers alone cannot achieve these innovations. Their options depend also on government policies, guidance from agricultural extension services, and the products and pricing of private-sector distributors of seeds, tools and fertilizers.\nDecision makers in Tanzania and Malawi recognize that climate change threatens their economies and people, but they are far removed from farmers’ daily lives. The idea of this project is to link farmers and service providers in shared learning. The research helps farmers to use reliable information, and provides training and tools to give them options. The aim is to see stakeholders learn together and then to scale up successful strategies. “This study intends to promote two-way communication, involving all partners and supporting their information and other needs,” says project leader, Amos Majule.\nIntegrating knowledge and experience at different levels\nThe research draws on the experience and coping strategies of farming families. It also builds on existing initiatives, including National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) in both countries, which emphasize agriculture and farmers’ livelihood strategies in relation to climate change.\nThe Nazareti Women’s Group in Chibelela village is among those involved in establishing a farmers’ field school to test modern techniques in water, soil and crop management. “We are participating in the research as local partners,” says Keziya Magawa, Chair of the group. “We discuss with other researchers how we can make agricultural practices more flexible to climate change.” The villagers are noticing changes in Tanzania: “In the past, the rains lasted from November through April, but this year, we experienced only drops of water in February. We planted, but we do not know if we will harvest anything,” says Magawa.\nLearning from practical experience\nGrowing conditions vary widely within Tanzania and Malawi, and this project is working in eight villages in each country, reflecting the range of regional conditions. In the learning plots, farmers, researchers and suppliers test innovations proposed and mutually agreed through participatory planning. In central Tanzania, for example, stakeholders opted to test a range of tillage equipment – from power tillers to ox-drawn ploughs and hoes – and different fertilizers and seed varieties, including drought-tolerant varieties of sorghum and maize.\nIn Malawi, activities have focused on crop diversification, with crops including improved forms of maize, sweet potato and sorghum. In Mphampha village, rain-fed agriculture proved almost impossible due to a prolonged dry spell during the growing season, so irrigation was added, and may have saved an otherwise lost food supply.\nBenedict Mwaluko, an agricultural extension officer in Tanzania’s Dodoma region, credits local farmers for their contributions to informing policies on adaptation: “We hope this research will result in policy change and the adaptation of agricultural systems, since farmers are already responding by providing their lands for field experiments”.",
    "What Factors Help Determine Nitrogen Rates?\nNov 21, 2012\nQuestion: What is the deciding factor in varying the rate of nitrogen? Is it relative to CEC?\nAnswer: There are multiple factors that have to be put into play. Are you dealing with a high-yield or low-yield environment (both of which can be in a single field)? What is the plant density--are we pushing for high yields? What is the soil’s ability to supply nitrogen?\nTraditionally that is a factor dealing with organic matter CEC. The healthier the soil, the more nitrogen it usually supplies. But, it can also depend on field history such as whether it’s been in corn-on-corn, or if manure has been applied to it. One of the things we’re looking at is testing for organic nitrogen followed up with nitrate testing, trying to predict high, medium or low mineralization rates.\nThe last thing we need to tie into this is the potential for nitrogen loss through nitrification or leeching. An example of this would be a high-yield environment with the ability to supply sufficient nitrogen that it would allow us to reduce our input of nitrogen. Yet that environment could be a high-risk area due to drainage, or, under wet conditions the nitrogen could be lost and we’d have to rescue those areas with more nitrogen.",
    "Tampa, FL (Aug. 11, 2009) -- A 65-year-old women goes into the hospital for routine hip surgery. Six months later, she develops memory loss and is later diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. Just a coincidence? Researchers at the University of South Florida and Vanderbilt University don't think so. They suspect that the culprit precipitating Alzheimer's disease in the elderly women may be a routine administration of high concentrations of oxygen for several hours during, or following, surgery – a hypothesis borne out in a recent animal model study.\nDr. Gary Arendash of the Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at USF and Dr. L. Jackson Roberts II at Vanderbilt University used mice genetically altered to develop abnormal levels of the protein beta amyloid, which deposits in the brain as plaques and eventually leads to Alzheimer's-like memory loss as the mice age. They found that young adult Alzheimer's mice exposed to 100-percent oxygen during several 3-hour sessions demonstrated substantial memory loss not otherwise present at their age. Young adult Alzheimer's mice exposed to normal air had no measurable memory loss, and neither did normal mice without any genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease.\nThe authors suggest that people genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's disease or with excessive amounts of beta amyloid in their brains are at increased risk of developing the disease earlier if they receive high concentrations of oxygen, known as hyperoxia. Their study is published online this month in NeuroReport.\n\"Although oxygen treatment beneficially increases the oxygen content of blood during or after major surgery, it also has several negative effects that we believe may trigger Alzheimer's symptoms in those destined to develop the disease,\" said USF neuroscientist Arendash, the study's lead author. \"Our study suggests that the combination of brain beta amyloid and exposure to high concentrations of oxygen provides a perfect storm for speeding up the onset of memory loss associated with Alzheimer's Disease.\"\nWhile postoperative confusion and memory problems are common and usually transient in elderly patients following surgery, some patients develop permanent Alzheimer's-like cognitive impairment that remains unexplained. Recent studies have indicated that general anesthesia administered during surgery may increase a patient's risk of Alzheimer's disease, but the laboratory studies did not use animals or people predisposed to develop the disease.\n\"Postoperative memory loss can be a fairly common and devastatingly irreversible problem in the elderly after major surgical procedures,\" said Roberts, an MD who holds an endowed chair in Pharmacology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \"There has been much speculation as to the cause of this memory loss, but the bottom line is that no one really knows why it happens. If all it takes to prevent this is reducing the exposure of patients to unnecessarily high concentrations of oxygen in the operating room, this would be a major contribution to geriatric medicine.\"\nThe USF-Vanderbilt study looked at 11 young adult mice genetically modified to develop memory problems as they aged, mimicking Alzheimer's disease. After behavioral tests confirmed the mice had not yet developed memory impairment at age 3 months – about age 40 in human years – the researchers exposed half the Alzheimer's mice to 100-percent oxygen for three hours, three times over the next several months. The protocol was intended to replicate initial and supplemental exposures of elderly patients in hospital operating rooms and recovery suites to high concentrations of oxygen. The other half of the mice were exposed to 21-percent oxygen, the concentration of oxygen in typical room air.\nWhen researchers retested the mice after the final gas exposure, they found that Alzheimer's mice exposed to 100-percent oxygen performed much worse on tests measuring their memory and thinking skills than the Alzheimer's mice exposed to normal room air. In fact, the Alzheimer's mice exposed to room air demonstrated no memory loss. Moreover, exposure of young adult mice without beta amyloid protein deposited in their brains to 100-percent oxygen did not adversely affect their memories. This is consistent with studies in humans showing that exposure of young adults to high concentrations of oxygen has no harmful effects on memory.\nThe researchers also demonstrated that even a single 3-hour exposure to 100-percent oxygen caused memory deficits in the Alzheimer's mice. Furthermore, when they examined the brains of these mice, they found dramatic increases in levels of isofurans, products of oxygen-induced damage from toxic free radicals. The increase was not present in the brains of normal control mice exposed to the single hyperoxia treatment.\nHow might high concentrations of oxygen hasten memory impairment in those destined to develop Alzheimer's disease? The researchers suggest the striking increase of isofurans during surgery may be one triggering mechanism, particularly in cardiac bypass surgery where very high blood oxygen levels are routinely attained and permanent memory loss often occurs months after the surgery. Secondly, exposure to high concentrations of oxygen prompts abnormal swelling of brain cell terminals that transmit chemical messages from one brain cell to another and may further disrupt already frayed nerve cell connections in those at risk for Alzheimer's. Third, high concentrations of oxygen combined with beta amyloid plaques constricts blood vessels and decreases blood flow to the brain more than either one alone.\nThe authors caution that the study in mice may or may not accurately reflect the effects of hyperoxia in human surgery patients.\n\"Nonetheless, our results call into question the wide use of unnecessarily high concentrations of oxygen during and/or following major surgery in the elderly,\" Roberts said. \"These oxygen concentrations often far exceed that required to maintain normal hemoglobin saturation in elderly patients undergoing surgery.\"",

    "Researchers identify proteins that indicate which kidney tumors are most likely to spread\nResearchers at St. Michael's hospital have identified 29 proteins that are likely to be involved in the spread of kidney cancer. The discovery will help physicians recognize which tumours are going to behave more aggressively and provide those patients with more intensive treatment and closer followup.\n\"Metastatic renal cell carcinoma is one of the most treatment-resistant malignancies and patients have dismal prognosis,\" said Dr. George M Yousef, a laboratory pathologist. \"Identification of markers that can predict the potential of metastases will have a great impact on improvement patient outcomes.\nDr. Yousef's research appears online in the journal Molecular & Cellular Proteomics.\nKidney cancer in general is very aggressive and has a high chance of metastasis, or spreading to other organs. The five-year survival rate for metastasized kidney cancer is less than 10 per cent. Although imaging technology has led to increased detection of kidney tumours, 25 to 30 per cent have already spread by the time they are found.\nUsing a mass spectrometer, Dr. Yousef identified 29 proteins that change when cancer cells spread from the original site of the kidney tumour. All 29 proteins have been previously been linked to other malignancies.\nDr. Yousef said if physicians can determine which kidney tumours have those proteins, and are likely to spread, they can monitor and treat those patients more aggressively. Patients who don't have those proteins and biomarkers might not have to undergo costly and intensive treatment or surgery.\nThe next steps would be to find ways to stop the proteins from turning on and triggering the metastasis.\nJournal reference: Molecular & Cellular Proteomics\nProvided by St. Michael's Hospital\n- Kidney tumors have a mind of their own Nov 21, 2012 | not rated yet | 0\n- FDA clears Pfizer drug for advanced kidney cancer Jan 27, 2012 | not rated yet | 0\n- Study identifies surgical means for improving kidney cancer survival Jun 02, 2010 | not rated yet | 0\n- Active surveillance provides a viable alternative to surgery for small kidney masses Oct 17, 2012 | not rated yet | 0\n- New biomarkers for predicting the spread of colon cancer Jan 13, 2010 | not rated yet | 0\n- Separate lives: Neuronal and organismal lifespans decoupled Mar 27, 2013 | 4.9 / 5 (8) | 0\n- Sizing things up: The evolutionary neurobiology of scale invariance Feb 28, 2013 | 4.8 / 5 (10) | 14\nHow can there be villous adenoma in colon, if there are no villi there\n10 hours ago As title suggest.

    "Up on the roof of Professor Fritz Vollrath's lab in the zoology department atOxford University, there is a makeshift greenhouse in which he nurtures his favourite golden orb web spiders. Walking into the greenhouse is a little like finding yourself inside one of those Damien Hirst vitrines that dramatise fast-forward life and death. The air is frenzied with the buzz of flies and thick with the smell of rotting fruit; look up and dozens of the mature African spiders, three inches across, are sitting pretty on elaborate webs among the foliage, clearly living the arachnid life of Riley. Vollrath points out their offspring, thousands of tiny spiderlings, scurrying about on leaves beneath.\nIt seems a good place to ask him exactly how he first got interested in spiders and their webs. He laughs and turns the question around. \"The strange thing to me,\" he says, \"was always the question of why scientists were not more interested in them. I mean, here is a creature which, according to its size, can build from its own body a structure on the scale of a football pitch overnight, every night, and can catch the equivalent of an aeroplane in it. Why would you not want to study how it did that?\"\nThere were more practical reasons, too. Vollrath was a graduate student of neurophysiology when he started looking at webs and spider silks in earnest. \"To do any small thing in neurophysiology, you had to read an awful lot of scientific literature. With spiders, I realised there was hardly any literature at all. You could just do a lot of looking.\"\nHis fascination with spider silk began when he was at university in Munich in 1972 and the lightweight, high-tensile Olympic park, designed by Frei Otto to mimic spider-web construction, created a new imaginative framework for architecture. Vollrath, who speculated that spider silk might generate a similar revolutionary shift in the emergent field of biomaterials, was snared.\nIn the years since, he has probably spent more time studying how spiders spin their everyday miracles than any man alive. He has fed spiders drugs, tiny droplets of amphetamines and caffeine, and measured the dramatic disruptive effect it has on their web building. He has tested ways of training spiders with a tuning fork and discovered how to make them to \"write\" in their webs – the Vollrath Christmas card of 1988 featured a picture of a web in which he had \"taught\" a spider to write the number \"88\" by manipulating the orientation of the web as the spider worked. Mostly, though, Vollrath has defined a pioneering area of study into the properties of spider silks that not only promises to revolutionise various polymer industries, but also could have huge potential medical benefits for humans in everything from knee replacements to nerve repair to heart transplants.",
    "Jonas Salk, with both eloquence and simplicity, once stated that there are two primary approaches to treating ill people. He said that there are therapeutic techniques that directly impact specific symptoms, and there are methods that stimulate the body's own immune and defense system.\nWhereas conventional medical treatments today tend to focus on the former goal of treating or controlling symptoms, various natural therapeutics primarily attend to the latter goal of augmenting the person's own inherent defenses. Although the direct treatment of symptoms often has immediate effects, its benefits tend to be short-term. Because such therapeutic interventions do not usually strengthen the person's own defenses, the individual remains prone to recurrence of their problem.\nIn contrast, therapeutic methods that strengthen a person's immune and defense system has longer term benefit and can prevent recurrence, but the benefit is sometimes achieved more slowly.\nThese generalizations about therapeutic methods are, however, just that, generalizations. There are plenty of exceptions, but these generalizations create a useful framework from which to evaluate the benefits and limitations of various therapeutic approaches.\nHomeopathy and Immune Response\nHomeopathy obviously fits into the class of therapeutic methods that augment the body's own defenses. The basis of homeopathy, called the principle of similars, suggests that a microdose of a substance will heal whatever pattern of symptoms this substances causes in large dose. This principle is also observed in the use of vaccinations and allergy treatments, though homeopathic medicines are both considerably smaller and safer in dose and more individualized to the person they are being used to treat.\nAlthough homeopathic medicines are thought to stimulate the body's own defenses, how they do so remains a mystery. One study published in the European Journal of Pharmacology1 showed that a homeopathic medicine, Silicea, stimulated macrophages (macrophages are a part of the body's immune system which engulf bacteria and foreign substances). How or why Silicea was able to have this action or why exceedingly small doses of it are so active is unknown. In the same way that physicians and pharmacologists do not understand how many drugs work, we do not understand how homeopathic medicine actually work.\nHomeopathic medicine do not simply stimulate the body's immune system to treat ill people, for they can also calm it when this is necessary for the healing of the individual. An example of this latter effect was observed in a study of the homeopathic treatment of people with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition which is considered an autoimmune illness. People with auto-immune ailments suffer because their body's immune system is over-active and it attacks the person's own cells, not just bacteria, viruses, or foreign substances.\nThis study on 46 people with rheumatoid arthritis showed that those given an individualized choice of homeopathic medicine got considerably more relief than those given a placebo.2 A total of 82% of those people given a homeopathic medicine experienced relief of pain, while only 21% of those given a placebo got a similar degree of relief.\nHomeopathy and Infectious Diseases\nToward the end of Louis Pasteur's life, he had come to realize that germs may not be the cause of disease afterall, but instead are probably the results of disease. In other words, various bacteria and other infective organisms may be present when there is some type of disease, but infection tends to establish itself primarily when a person's own defenses are compromised sufficiently to make him susceptible to the infection.",
    "LP/Lisp: Literate Programming for Lisp\nWhat is LP/Lisp?\nLP/Lisp is a software tool to provide literate programming support for Lisp programmers. Literate programming is the idea that the code and the documentation for a program should form a coherent whole, a work of literature with two audiences, the computer and humans. The idea was originated by Donald Knuth, who created the WEB system (using TeX and Pascal). This has been expanded upon since then, with literate programming (LP) tools such as cweb, fweb, noweb, and so forth.\nUnfortunately, the model used by these tools is not the one we usually use when programming in Lisp. Since we don't have a write-compile-execute cycle with Lisp, these tools inject an artificial step into the process, interfering with the natural way Lisp is used.\nLP/Lisp is a new LP tool that is meant to allow Lisp programmers to use LP without interfering with the normal way they program. The LP file is the Lisp file itself. Documentation and LP markup reside in the comments. Markup exists to do the usual LP-like things (definition of and reference to chunks of code, syntactic sugaring for sections and formatting, etc.). The documentation is stripped out of the comments by LP/Lisp, with code reordered and formatted as needed, to form a LaTeX file.\nThere have been other approaches to LP in Lisp as well (e.g., CLWEB, Scribble, pbook, etc.). These are discussed in the paper about LP/Lisp.\nWhat is written about it?\n- LP/Lisp: Literate Programming for Lisp, Roy M. Turner, in Proceedings of the International Lisp Conference (ILC), Reno, NV, 2010.\n- Literate Programmimg in Lisp (LP/Lisp), Roy M. Turner (2010). Technical report 2010-02, Department of Computer Science, University of Maine, 5752 Neville Hall, Orono, ME 04469-5752. The version on-line will often be more current than the version available as a technical report.\nWhat is available now?\nThe lisp code is available as lplisp.lisp. It has only been tested under Allegro Common Lisp, and it is unlikely to work under other Lisps at the moment, since it requires ACL's regexp2 package. See below.\nWhat is coming?\nThe next version is in the works. It will fix some of the syntax oddness of the current version, and it will be less tied to ACL. It will be a complete, object-oriented rewrite. It will be posted here when it's ready.\nStay in touch\nIf you are using LP/Lisp, drop me a line to let me know, so I can send you mail when there are changes, the next version is ready, etc. Also let me know of bugs you discover or features you would like to see--this isn't my primary project by a long-shot, but I'll try to respond as soon as possible!\nThanks for your interest in LP/Lisp, and I hope it is useful for you.",
    "For some, it’s a time of decline and decay, of frenzied wood gathering and other dour preparations for the upcoming days of winter. But for many, myself included, fall is the most invigorating season of all.\nSome think that spring is the prime time for wildflowers; yet, the fall wildflower season is equally spectacular — and perhaps even more varied and interesting. Joe Pye weed, iron weed, cardinal flower, goldenrods, various woodland orchids, gentians, and others are just some of the showy species associated with the fall months. But the quintessential fall wildflower is surely the aster.\nHere in the Smokies region there are 30 or so asters. These can often be difficult to identify down to the species level. The best non-technical field guides for this purpose, in my opinion, are Lawrence Newcomb’s Newcomb’s Wildflower Guide (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1977), supplemented by Richard M. Smith’s Wildflowers of the Southern Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1998) and Jack B. Carman’s Wildflowers of Tennessee. (Tullahoma TN: Highland Rim Press, 2001).\nDon’t become too frustrated if — even after consulting these and other sources — you can’t make a final decision as to the precise species you’re attempting to identify. In this regard, Jim Horton, now retired after a distinguished career as a botanist at Western Carolina University, observed in The Summer Times (Tampa: Cider Press, 1979) that, “The asters form a nearly continuous series of variant forms. This means that while any two aster plants may be quite different from each other and may obviously belong to different species, it is possible to find... plants that are transitional between one variant and the next.” In other words, even the experts can’t always determine which species of aster they’re trying to identify. It’s my experience that the same observation can be made in regard to goldenrods.\nWhen one hears the name “aster,” he or she usually conjures up an image of a purplish-blue flower with a disc shape. But more than a few aster species bear small white flowers. Several of the white-flowered aster species blossom by early September.\nAccordingly, Donald and Lillian Stokes, in their informative book A Guide to Enjoying Wildflowers (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1985), noted that, “The name ‘aster’ comes from the Greek word for ‘star,’ but the small-white-flowered species, called frost asters, should have been named after the Milky Way. They bear such an abundance of tiny blossoms among roadside grasses that they look like the mass of stars you see strewn across the sky on a clear night. In fact, one legend says that asters are a result of a god scattering stardust across the land.”\nLong ago, I was discussing fall wildflowers with an elderly woman on her farm near Sylva. She kept referring to a group of flowers she was particularly fond of that she knew as “Farewell to Summer.” Curious as to exactly what she was talking about, I asked her to show me some.\n“Sure enough,” she said. I followed her into the garden behind her home, where she pointed to a beautiful stand of large-leaved asters (Aster macrophyllus) in full bloom that, she advised me, her husband had transferred from the wild into their garden when they were married.\n“When they bloom, you know fall’s a-coming,” she said.",

    "If you need bat help, click on my Nationwide List of Bat Removal Experts for a pro near you.\nHow to Catch a Bat - Bats are incredibly complex and interesting creatures. They thrive in the outdoors and live for the dark. This is why, if you find a bat in your house, chances are the bat is sick (with rabies or other harmful diseases) or unsuspectingly flew into your house to chase bugs. It might be afraid because it doesn’t know where it is and can be a danger to itself and humans. Catching a bat humanely is not difficult—it only takes a little bit of strategy and patience.\nBefore you try to catch a bat directly it is worth seeing if the\nbat will leave on its own\n. Open the door to the room and keep the lights off. Go to the end of the room with a container that you can scratch, such as a yogurt container or milk jug. By scratching the container you are creating sound waves which will help the bat detect the outline of the door. When it realizes it has an exit, the bat will fly off on its own.\nIf this strategy doesn’t work—because the bat just doesn’t leave or it is in a room in the middle of the house—you can remove the bat yourself. Make sure to take necessary precautions to protect yourself before you try to catch and touch the bat. Wearing oven mitts or rubber or leather gloves will be sure to keep you from begin bitten and infected with rabies.\nUsing a fishing or butterfly net\nis one option—just make sure the holes in the net aren’t too big so the bat cannot squeeze out through a hole. This doesn’t always work well because of bats’ ability to detect small objects through sonar. The best net to use is a special bat net called a mist net which is made of really fine fibers and harder to detect. If the bat detects the swinging net, it will fly away and sit in a hard to reach place. If you manage to catch the bat, close the top of the net and bring it outside.\nOther option is to wait for the bat to land on a sturdy surface and within reach. Snatching a bat out of mid air is tricky and will frighten the bat—making it defensive and aggressive. If the bat lands on a horizontal surface, such as the floor or a table,\nthrow a small towel\n, t-shirt or piece of fabric over the bat. This should keep the bat from flying and hiding again. Using a light piece of fabric will inhibit the bat from moving but will not harm the bat either. Scoop the bat up in the towel and keep the bat inside.\nThe bat will be frightened at this point and making clicking noises, but do not release it. Be sure to leave your gloves on as the bat will most likely try to bite through the towel or t-shirt. If you release it once it is afraid, it will be more difficult to capture it again because it will either be aggressive or hide in a hard-to-reach place.\nIf the bat lands on a banister or side wall and you cannot throw a towel over it, try to place a\ncoffee can or other container\ncarefully over the bat. With gloves still on, slide the lid to the container between the bat and the wall—do not pinch any part of the bat.\nTake the towel or the container outside a good distance from your house or apartment. Make sure you close your door behind you so the bat cannot fly back inside. Release the bat and back away slowly. Watch the bat’s behavior before going back inside. It will probably hop a few times and gather its bearing and then fly away.\nIf the bat is too tired from struggling in the towel or in the container or still too frightened to move, you may want to scoop it back up again with your gloved hands and place it on the bark of the tree. When handling the bat, be as gentle as possible and do not squeeze the bat. The bat will attach itself to the trunk and when it is ready the bat may climb back up into the tree and rest and take flight from there.\nThere is no reason to ever hurt or kill a bat to get it to exit your house. If you take a little time and a little planning, you can easily capture the bat and release it back into the wild.\nMore in-detail how-to bat removal articles:\nInformation about bat trapping\n- analysis and methods for how to trap.\nInformation about how to kill a bat\n- with fumigants or poison.\nInformation about how to keep bats away\n- prevention techniques.\nInformation about bat repellent\n- analysis of types and effectiveness.\nYou came here to learn how to catch a bat in your house.

    "Chanucah, the festival of lights, is, in our own day, mainly the commemoration of a spiritual event. Its historical roots, however, as set out in the Book of Maccabees, were the celebration of a great military victory over the Syrian-Greek overlords.\nThe Talmud's description concentrates on the laws of keeping the Chanucah lights burning (Masechet Shabbat 21b-24a). When it does offer historical reasons, they are largely to do with the miracle that fell on the eight days of the initial festival. Compared to the Book of Maccabees, the idea of a light that lasted eight days is a complete fabrication of the sages. No mention of such a light exists in the account of the rebellion of the Maccabees against the enemy. Josephus concurs with the reading of the Book of Maccabees.\nAmong other things that Judah Maccabee did was to \"rebuild the sanctuary and the interior of the Temple and consecrate the courts… Early on the morning on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month…they offered sacrifices, as the law directs, on the new altar of burnt offerings that they had built. At the very season… that the Gentiles had profaned it, it was dedicated with songs and harps and lutes and cymbals \" (I Maccabees. 4: 48-54).\nLots about work in the Temple. Not a word about the miracle of the light! The Maccabees were not a subtle lot. A story told of their battles against their enemies appears in both the Book of Maccabees as well as in the post-biblical, rabbinical text, Megillat Ta'anit, which records the extra days on which people in the second Temple period celebrated. None of these days, apart from Chanucah and Purim, have survived.\nOn the thirteenth day of Adar, it is written that Nicanor Pulmarchus, who was the head of the Greek army, shook his fist at Jerusalem and against the Temple and swore to destroy it. \"When the Maccabees attacked and destroyed his soldiers, they cut off their heads, they cut off their big toes and thumbs, they reached his carriage, they cut off his head, and cut away his limbs and hung them against the Temple. They said: 'A mouth that spoke against Jews and Jerusalem with such arrogance, and a fist that shook against it, should have a revenge taken against them.' They made this day into a holiday\" (Megillat Ta'anit, Adar).\nThe Maccabees' version adds to this list of gruesome features: \"When the action was over… they recognised Nicanor, lying dead in full armour… and he [Judah] cut out the tongue of the ungodly Nicanor and said he would give it piecemeal to the birds and hang up these rewards of his folly opposite the sanctuary… And they all... blessed the Lord\" (II Maccabees 15: 28-34).\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that these Maccabees and their descendants came into conflict with the sages. Such behaviour, however difficult the circumstances, was not to be countenanced by the people of Israel, whose life revolved around the concept of all men being made in the image of God.\nBy the time the Maccabees took upon themselves the role of sovereigns as well as priests, the sages had become outcasts in their own society. They were often forced to flee into a neighbouring country to save themselves from death at the hands of the ruling Maccabees.\nIn this book Pirkei Avot: A New Israeli Commentary, Professor Avigdor Shinan suggests that the early sages mentioned in that Mishnah - from Yossi ben Yo'ezer to Shimon ben Shetach - were all people who were pursued by the Maccabee kings, particularly Jochanan Hyrcanus and Alexander Yannai.\nThese sages, not to mention those who came after them, were aware of the dangers of mixing politics and religion. For this reason, the sages emphasised the idea of bringing Torah into your house, since learning Torah by the sages in a public place, was banned.\nThe lessons that the sages learnt from this episode was clearly one in which the separation of powers was essential if there was going to be a society motivated by the words of Torah.\nA similar lesson is to be learned today if the light of Chanucah is not to be doused by the flood of fanaticism, religious or political, and this festival not given over to a show of extreme nationalism.",
    "About the artwork\nThe view in this picture is from the Liverpool dock shore looking towards Birkenhead and Tranmere. St Mary's Church in Birkenhead can be clearly seen as can the, still extant, windmill on Bidston Hill and another above Tranmere. Although the architecture is a rather generalised mixture of chimneys and houses some sense of the substantial distinctive new stone terraces of Hamilton Square in Birkenhead is conveyed.\nDockside parting scenes were popular pictorial subjects during the 1850s. The most famous of these was a picture by Henry Nelson O'Neill, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1857, entitled 'Eastwood Ho August 1857'. It showed soldiers leaving for India after the Indian Mutiny. An engraving after O'Neill's picture was published in 1860 and may have part-prompted Lee's choice of subject.\nThe figures of women and men on the dockside are probably all portraits, or if not, then certainly based upon studies made from real people. The artist himself appears on three occasions - as the sailor facing the viewer from the right-hand corner, as the young sailor talking to the woman holding a green umbrella and as the sailor in profile, this time bearded, embracing the woman in the Paisley shawl. In the rowing boat an older bearded man appears twice. Although we do not know his name he was also used by the artist as a model in another picture. Of particular interest is the just visible black sailor in the rowing boat. He too appears in naval uniform. There were many black sailors in Liverpool and this one appears to be of South-east Asian origin.\nAnchored in the centre of the River Mersey is HMS Majestic, an obsolete 80 gun wooden warship. She had been used during the Crimean War and was not only sail-powered but also screw-driven. Between 1860 and 1866 she was part of the river defences of Liverpool and was scrapped in 1868. Her most memorable achievement during her period on the Mersey was the prevention from leaving the river of two American Confederate warships that had been built at Laird's shipyard in Birkenhead. The men who are leaving to board her may only be going on a tour of duty lasting a week or two. The provisions that they appear to be taking with them include a barrel of the beer, which, according to the inscription on its top, is from Alsopp's brewery.\nThe use of models, the precise delineation of specific fabrics, the attention to topographical accuracy and above all the use of very bright colours applied in small brushstrokes onto a white ground makes this a Pre-Raphaelite picture in the manner of Holman Hunt. In the very small group of pictures that can with certainty be ascribed to John Lee this one is usually considered to be his masterpiece. For this reason it was bought in 1980 to add to the Walker's collection.\nSo strong was the feeling within the Liverpool Academy for and against Pre-Raphaelite principles that it eventually lead to the institution itself splitting into fragmented exhibiting societies. This was not in the interest of any of the artists involved. It was not really until the founding of the Liverpool Autumn Exhibition in 1873 that major exhibiting opportunities for artists from within and outside of Liverpool again arose.\nJohn Lee (active 1859 -1867) was one of the group of Merseyside artists who, during the 1850s and 1860s, admired and emulated the brightly-coloured, minutely detailed painting style of the London based Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Very little is known about Lee. He exhibited at the Liverpool Academy between 1859 and 1867 and at the Royal Academy in London between 1863 and 1867. He lived in Rock Ferry near Birkenhead and had a studio in Liverpool. In 1866 he moved to London, possibly in part prompted by the demise of the Liverpool Academy.\nLiverpool was unique among provincial towns in having a substantial Pre-Raphaelite following among its artists. In part this arose as a result of the exhibiting opportunities that were available to outside artists who were able to show at the annual Liverpool Academy exhibition. There was a £50 ‘non-member prize’ awarded by the Liverpool Academy that was won on seven occasions between 1851 and 1859 by London Pre-Raphaelites or their associates. John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, Ford Madox Brown, and William Dyce all won this prize on one or more occasions.\nIn part, Pre-Raphaelitism developed in Liverpool because of the vigorous advocacy of its principles by the artist William Windus, who, having first visited the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1851, returned to Liverpool full of enthusiasm for the new movement. Windus became in effect the leader of a younger group of artists within the Liverpool Academy who sought to distance themselves from more traditional figures like the topographical view painter Herdman and the animal painter Huggins. Also among the several prosperous individuals buying pictures in Liverpool was a tobacco merchant, John Miller of Everton, who bought a number of works by both London and Liverpool Pre-Raphaelite painters.",
    "Nancy Flanagan has written another of her all-too-numerous to count insightful posts. This one is called I’m OK–You Have Self-Esteem. She approaches the concept of self-esteem in a thoughtful and balanced way, and it’s another of her “must-reads.”\nIn that post, she mentions a study that came out last year that, as she puts it, “dared to suggest that kids perform better when given the simple assignment of writing for fifteen minutes about their strengths, to re-affirm their competence.” I remember reading about it in the New York Times, and also remember thinking to myself that I needed to find out more about what exactly the researchers had the students do. That task has languished on my “to do” list until Nancy’s post prompted me to finally get around to doing some digging.\nHere is my summary of what the researchers actually did (you can purchase the article here. I don’t think the article itself is very helpful, but the online addendum is).\nThey had students write three-to-five times during one school year about their values.\nThe first two times, students were given this list of values:\nathletic ability, being good at art, being smart or getting good grades, creativity, independence, living in the moment, membership in a social group (such as your community, racial group, or school club), music, politics, relationships with friends or family, religious values, and sense of humor.\nThe first time, they were asked to circle one; the second time,they were asked to circle the two or three on the list that were most important to them.\nNext, they were asked to think about times when those two or three values (the first time, they just wrote about the one they circled) were most important to them, and then to write a few sentences about why they were important to them.\nFinally, students were asked to write if they agreed or disagreed with these statements (there were six levels of agreement/disagreement that students could check):\n“These values have influenced my life”\n“In general, I try to live up to these values”\n“These values are an important part of who I am.”\nIn the third, fourth, and/or fifth times, researchers made minor changes such as giving a different list of values, or asking students to write about which values might be most important during a certain time period, like Winter Break.\nThough the academic improvement among students wasn’t enormous, it was certainly measurable, and appeared to be sustained after they left the class.\nThe researchers started their experiment at the beginning of the school year, and spaced the exercises out every two or three months.\nI’m certainly going to give it a try, and start now. I’m hopeful it will help, and reflecting on values is certainly never going to hurt. I’ll also have students share what they wrote with a partner, and invite class-wide discussion. We do reflective writing each Friday, so it should fit right in.\nI’ll let readers know how it goes.\nIf you’ve tried something like this, or are now going to do so, please leave a comment now or in the future, too.",

(92.1 x 122.6 cm)\nCleveland Museum of Art\nGeorge Bellows (1882-1925): Modern American Life\nLONDON, ENGLAND • Royal Academy of Arts • 16 March - 9 June 2013\n|George Bellows (1882–1925) was regarded as one of America's greatest artists when he died, at the age of forty-two, from a ruptured appendix. Bellows's early fame rested on his powerful depictions of boxing matches and gritty scenes of New York City's tenement life, but he also painted cityscapes, seascapes, war scenes, and portraits, and made illustrations and lithographs that addressed many of the social, political, and cultural issues of the day. Featuring some 120 works from Bellows's extensive oeuvre, this loan exhibition is the first comprehensive survey of the artist's career in nearly half a century.|\nBorn and raised in Columbus, Ohio, George Bellows attended Ohio State University, where his athletic talents suggested that he might become a professional baseball player and his illustrations for the student yearbook hinted at an artistic calling. In 1904, before graduating, he moved to New York City to study art with Robert Henri, one of America’s most influential teachers in the period. Bellows would become the leading young member of the Ashcan School artists, all of whom Henri inspired. The Ashcan artists aimed to chronicle the realities of daily life, and Bellows was the boldest and most versatile among them in his choice of subjects, palettes, and techniques. Bellows never traveled abroad, but learned the lessons of European masters—such as El Greco, Francisco de Goya, Édouard Manet, and others who nourished Ashcan realism — by studying their works in museums, including the Metropolitan.\nWhen, in 1911, the Metropolitan acquired his canvas Up the Hudson (1908) as its first Ashcan painting, Bellows became one of the youngest artists to be represented in the Museum’s collection. His candid portrayals of New York City, Maine’s rugged coast, boxers in the ring, the atrocities of World War I, friends and family members, and other distinctive themes are among the triumphs of early 20th-century art.\nThe exhibition is organized thematically, within a chronological framework:\nNew York, 1905–1908; Boxers and Portraits, 1907–1909; Penn Station and the Hudson River, 1907–1909; Work and Leisure, 1910–16; The Sea, 1911–17; Bellows’s Process, 1912–16; The War, 1918; Bellows’s Process, 1916–23; Family and Friends, 1914–19; and Late Works, 1920–24.\nRoyal Academy of Arts Website\n||Royal Academy of Arts|\nLondon W1J 0BD\nTel: (44) 20 73 00 59 95",
    "Campbell implies, oddly, that because both efficiency of energy use and energy consumption have increased over the past 125 years, energy efficiency causes increased consumption.\nFirstly, there are many reasons for increased consumption: economic, military, political, the invention of new energy-eating whimwhams, etc.\nSecondly, increased energy efficiency derives partly from increased knowhow, partly from political factors (such as OPEC) and partly from the certain knowledge that there will be various sorts of trouble if we don't get more from less. Without increased efficiency, the increase in fuel use would be vastly greater than it actually has been. Imagine the 1990s economy with the technology of 1870.\nThirdly, Campbell calls in evidence the 19th century economist Stanley Jevons. However, unlike physics, economics is not the same throughout time and space. Indeed, the alleged 'association' between increased efficiency and increased use reminds one of Jevons's assertion that there was an 'association' between...\nTo continue reading this article, subscribe to receive access to all of newscientist.com, including 20 years of archive content.",
    "PITTSBURGH—Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute have leveraged the latest browser technology to create GigaPan Time Machine, a system that enables viewers to explore gigapixel-scale, high-resolution videos and image sequences by panning or zooming in and out of the images while simultaneously moving back and forth through time.\nViewers, for instance, can use the system to focus in on the details of a booth within a panorama of a carnival midway, but also reverse time to see how the booth was constructed. Or they can watch a group of plants sprout, grow and flower, shifting perspective to watch some plants move wildly as they grow while others get eaten by caterpillars. Or, they can view a computer simulation of the early universe, watching as gravity works across 600 million light-years to condense matter into filaments and finally into stars that can be seen by zooming in for a close up.\n\"With GigaPan Time Machine, you can simultaneously explore space and time at extremely high resolutions,\" said Illah Nourbakhsh, associate professor of robotics and head of the CREATE Lab. \"Science has always been about narrowing your point of view — selecting a particular experiment or observation that you think might provide insight. But this system enables what we call exhaustive science, capturing huge amounts of data that can then be explored in amazing ways.\"\nThe system is an extension of the GigaPan technology developed by the CREATE Lab and NASA, which can capture a mosaic of hundreds or thousands of digital pictures and stitch those frames into a panorama that be interactively explored via computer. To extend GigaPan into the time dimension, image mosaics are repeatedly captured at set intervals, and then stitched across both space and time to create a video in which each frame can be hundreds of millions, or even billions of pixels.\nAn enabling technology for time-lapse GigaPans is a feature of the HTML5 language that has been incorporated into such browsers as Google's Chrome and Apple's Safari. HTML5, the latest revision of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) standard that is at the core of the Internet, makes browsers capable of presenting video content without use of plug-ins such as Adobe Flash or Quicktime.\nUsing HTML5, CREATE Lab computer scientists Randy Sargent, Chris Bartley and Paul Dille developed algorithms and software architecture that make it possible to shift seamlessly from one video portion to another as viewers zoom in and out of Time Machine imagery. To keep bandwidth manageable, the GigaPan site streams only those video fragments that pertain to the segment and/or time frame being viewed.\n\"We were crashing the browsers early on,\" Sargent recalled. \"We're really pushing the browser technology to the limits.\"\nGuidelines on how individuals can capture time-lapse images using GigaPan cameras are included on the site created for hosting the new imagery's large data files, http://timemachine.gigapan.org. Sargent explained the CREATE Lab is eager to work with people who want to capture Time Machine imagery with GigaPan, or use the visualization technology for other applications.\nOnce a Time Machine GigaPan has been created, viewers can annotate and save their explorations of it in the form of video \"Time Warps.\"\nThough the time-lapse mode is an extension of the original GigaPan concept, scientists already are applying the visualization techniques to other types of Big Data. Carnegie Mellon's Bruce and Astrid McWilliams Center for Cosmology, for instance, has used it to visualize a simulation of the early universe performed at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center by Tiziana Di Matteo, associate professor of physics.\n\"Simulations are a huge bunch of numbers, ugly numbers,\" Di Matteo said. \"Visualizing even a portion of a simulation requires a huge amount of computing itself.\" Visualization of these large data sets is crucial to the science, however. \"Discoveries often come from just looking at it,\" she explained.\nRupert Croft, associate professor of physics, said cosmological simulations are so massive that only a segment can be visualized at a time using usual techniques. Yet whatever is happening within that segment is being affected by forces elsewhere in the simulation that cannot be readily accessed. By converting the entire simulation into a time-lapse GigaPan, however, Croft and his Ph.D. student, Yu Feng, were able to create an image that provided both the big picture of what was happening in the early universe and the ability to look in detail at any region of interest.\nUsing a conventional GigaPan camera, Janet Steven, an assistant professor of biology at Sweet Briar College in Virginia, has created time-lapse imagery of rapid-growing brassicas, known as Wisconsin Fast Plants. \"This is such an incredible tool for plant biology,\" she said. \"It gives you the advantage of observing individual plants, groups of plants and parts of plants, all at once.\"\nSteven, who has received GigaPan training through the Fine Outreach for Science program, said time-lapse photography has long been used in biology, but the GigaPan technology makes it possible to observe a number of plants in detail without having separate cameras for each plant. Even as one plant is studied in detail, it's possible to also see what neighboring plants are doing and how that might affect the subject plant, she added.\nSteven said creating time-lapse GigaPans of entire landscapes could be a powerful tool for studying seasonal change in plants and ecosystems, an area of increasing interest for understanding climate change. Time-lapse GigaPan imagery of biological experiments also could be an educational tool, allowing students to make independent observations and develop their own hypotheses.",
    "Machu Picchu, Peru\nEverything about Machu Picchu makes you marvel that it ever came to exist. The lost city of the Incas is built on a saddle-shaped ridge slung between two giant peaks. Near-vertical slopes drop away on either side, down to a massive bend in the Urubamba River. What could have motivated the Incas to undertake such a construction at this remote location in the Andean cordillera? Machu Picchu, built over 700 years ago and hidden by jungle since the 16th century, was rediscovered in 1911. It consists of about 200 buildings, which include dwellings and temples, a central plaza and a royal palace, all flanked by terraces for farming.\nThe stone for the buildings was mined from a quarry and shaped using bronze tools, then smoothed with sand in order to fit tightly together. No mortar was used in the construction. Even after many centuries of wear and tear, the precision is amazing; It would be impossible to slide a piece of paper between many of the blocks. Machu Picchu is notable for the way that existing rock features were incorporated into the design. Inevitably the craftsmanship on sacred buildings is the finest. For spectacular views, make the steep climb up to Wayna Picchu, the mountain behind Machu Picchu. Alternatively, climb to the top of the less crowded Machu Picchu peak, which catches the first rays of the rising sun. Both mountains overlook the entire site, down to the river below, which puts the Incas· great achievement of construction into perspective.\nThe Incas worshipped the sun god Inti, so the summer solstice was the most important day in their calendar, and the Temple of the Sun their most important building. In fact, all their temples and sacred sites were designed to mark solar and astrological events. A stone, Intihuatana ('Hitching Post of the Sun'), is the focus of a major religious site where a ritual was performed, in the shortening days before the winter solstice, to prevent the sun disappearing. Similar stones were at other Inca sites, but were damaged or destroyed by Spanish conquistadores. The one at Machu Picchu survived because the site was never discovered. The population of Machu Picchu is believed to have numbered over a thousand, and the people were so distant from other settlements that they would have produced much of their own food. This accounts for the intricately terraced fields, which have survived remarkably intact thanks to the care and skill that went into their construction. Maize and potatoes were grown, and advanced irrigation techniques were used to ensure that rainwater didn't just run off down the hill to the Urubamba River far below.\nNo-one knows for sure why Machu Picchu was built. Some surmise that it was a royal or religious retreat for one of the Inca rulers. Certainly its remote location and altitude of nearly 2500 metres would seem to rule out any trade or military function. Whatever its use, the obvious effort that went into its construction indicates that it was considered important and held in high regard by those who created it.\nAll trips to Machu Picchu begin and end in Cuzco. The train journey from Cuzco to Aguas Calientes, the town in the river valley below the ruins, takes four hours. Buses go to and from the town to the ruins from 6 am until 5.30 pm. The trains from Cuzco arrive mid-morning and leave late in the afternoon, so the least crowded times at the",
    "Geography is not destiny but it is a good rule of thumb. With borders like this Palestine would struggle to keep a status quo out of war with Israel or at the very least a return to the Hamas-Fatah Civil War. The reasons for Palestine's geographic strikes against it are that the population sizes of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and their separation from each other by internationally-recognized Israel. A quick examination of excalves shows that having a Gaza Strip-exclave shows that the status quo as envisioned by the United Nations is undoable.\nExclaves are usually not causes of instability. In most cases open border travel, similar ethnic/national makeup, and the limited population size of exclaves help ensure peace by making state geographic unity unnecessary. For example, let us examine quickly exclaves that existed peacefully and some that failed.\n- Alaska-United States: Open borders and friendly relations with Canada, same ethnic/national groups as in the United States. 17% of the United States' landmass but only 0.2% of the total population.\n- European and former Soviet exclaves such as those in the Low Countries and even Kaliningrad: Open borders or custom unions which allow for easy travel. Very minimal in physical and population size (>.01)\n- Calbinda-Angola: Semi-open borders with varying relationship with Zaire/Congo, different ethnic/national groups. 1.9% of Angola's total population and 0.6% of the total landmass.\n- East Pakistan-Republic of Pakistan: In 1971 closed borders due to hostile relations with India. Very different ethnic/national groups between the exclave (Bangladesh) and present-day Pakistan. 18.5% of the country's landmass but 55% of the total population.\n- East Prussia-Nazi Germany: In 1939 closed borders due to Polish corridor and Polish fears of Nazi invasion. Same ethnic majority. 3.1% of Germany's population and 6.1% of Germany's landmass.\nBoth the Gaza Strip and West Bank are demographically the same. This will help reduce internal strife. Another Hamas-Fatah conflict is still possible but both populations will view themselves as one Palestinian nation which should remain in one state.\nThe trouble for Palestine concerns size and access. The long running tension between Israel and Palestinians is likely to keep borders closed. The critical blow to long term viability is in population size. The Gaza Strip only makes up 6.1% of United Nations-declared Palestine but comprises 44.5% of its total population.\nSomething like Palestine as recognized by the United Nations has never been done before. The only thing similar was East and West Pakistan, the difference being the separate ethnic groups, and that ended in monumental failure. Under a United Nations-envisioned Palestine, Palestinians would be one people separated nearly evenly with a hostile country in between. As such a permanent split between the Gaza Strip and West Bank is unlikely, though the lack of access between the two may drive some in Palestine to push for a war for geographic unity against Israel. Geography is not destiny, as I stated before, but the United Nations defined Palestine has been set upon an unknown and dangerous course.",
    "| Female Alaskan Hares nurse their young for an extended period, providing them with enough nutrition to grow extraordinarily quickly during the short Alaskan summer. There are an average of six furry little hares in a litter, and females usually bear just one litter per year. Alaskan Hares are among the largest hares. Their fur in winter is completely white except for black markings on the tips of the ears, and they molt to a darker summer coat that provides camouflage when the snow melts. They live in alder thickets and seem to ignore rain or snow instead of seeking shelter. Even very young hares in nests are regularly exposed to cold and rain.\nAlso known as:\nAlaska Tundra Hare, St. Michael's Hare, Swift Hare, Alaska Arctic Hare, Tundra Hare, Alaska Peninsula Hare, Ukalisukruk, Ugalishugruk, Ushkanuk, Okhotsk, Oo-skon\nMerriam, C.H., 1900.

    "More information about this Work\nThese three panels may have been the top of a polyptych similar to the one by Mariotto di Nardo in the Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence, whose central panel depicts a Virgin and Child. These panels, which were formerly in the Somerwell collection in Scotland, were auctioned at Sotheby’s in 1970 and were acquired for the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection in 1976. On the reverse of the Annunciate Angel is an old label that attributes the paintings to Giottino and states that they were in one of the storerooms in Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence when these buildings were demolished in 1826 to enlarge the square on which they were located.\nThe panels, which were unpublished prior to the auction of 1970, were catalogued as by Bicci di Lorenzo, an attribution that continues to be accepted today. For the two Annunciation panels the artist followed the traditional iconographic model used in Tuscan art in the 14th and 15th centuries: the Virgin is depicted seated with a book on her knees. She receives the message from the Angel Gabriel who approaches her on clouds, a detail that indicates that the angel arrives from Heaven. The Holy Spirit, sent by God the Father, is located above the Archangel and represented as Christ, who descends on the other panel towards Mary in the form of a dove.\nThe Crucifixion panel, with Christ still bleeding from his wounds, only includes the essential figures of the Virgin and Saint John. At the foot of the cross and near a pool of blood dripping from the plinth of the cross is Adam’s skull, whose presence, like the blood around it, symbolises the purification of Original Sin. At the top of the cross, from which a bright green branch is sprouting, is a pelican with its four young. According to legend, the pelican feeds its young on the blood that spouts from a wound that the bird makes in its own breast. The bird, combined with the crucifixion, emphasises Christ’s nature as Redeemer.\nIt has been tentatively suggested that the other elements in this polyptych were two panels with pairs of saints: Thaddeus and John the Baptist, and James the Less and Nicholas of Bari, both in the Pinacoteca Stuard in Parma. According to Boskovits these panels would have flanked a Virgin and Child, in an arrangement similar to the above-mentioned polyptych by Mariotto di Nardo. Bicci di Lorenzo, who inherited a large workshop from his father, continued to use Gothic formulas well into the 15th century, introducing small changes in an effort to modernise his style. This group has been dated around 1430.",
    "The Hebron Years\nKing David rose to political power in Israel gradually, over a number of years. He was chosen by God to replace King Saul while Saul still reigned (1 Samuel 16:1), but even after Saul died, David reigned only \"over the house of Judah\" for the next seven years. David's throne during The Civil War years was in Hebron (a civil war in which the South defeated the North).\n\"seven years reigned he in Hebron\"\nAfter years spent on the run from Saul (see David's Haunting), upon Saul's death in battle against the Philistines David asked The Lord if he could become more settled. The Lord answered that he could, and that Hebron was where he was to go. While there, men of Judah came and declared him to be their king. The civil war between Judah and the rest of the tribes of Israel, who made Saul's son Ish-bosheth their king, then began.\n\"And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of The Lord, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?\"\n\"And The Lord said unto him, Go up.\"\n\"And David said, Whither shall I go up?\"\n\"And he said, Unto Hebron.\"\n\"So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

    "Scientists step closer to artificial life\nPublished: Thursday, January 24, 2008 at 10:30 p.m.\nLast Modified: Thursday, January 24, 2008 at 10:30 p.m.\nWASHINGTON - It's another step in the quest to create artificial organisms: Scientists have synthesized the complete DNA of a type of bacteria.\nThe experiment, published online Thursday by the journal Science, isn't a living germ, just its genetic structure.\nBut scientists from Maryland's J. Craig Venter Institute called it the largest manmade stretch of DNA to date, and therefore a logical step in the fledgling field of \"synthetic biology\" that aims to build new organisms that work differently than nature intended, such as producing new fuels.\nThe Venter group started with some off-the-shelf laboratory-made DNA fragments. They overlapped and joined these stretches to make ever-larger chunks of genetic material until they finally had a manmade copy of the entire genome of a small bacterium called Mycoplasma genitalium, a genital germ.\nLast year, Venter's team performed a \"genome transplant\": Researchers transplanted all of the genes from one species of Mycoplasma into another, switching a goat germ into a cattle germ. Somehow, the transplant itself sparked the donor genes to start working; Venter uses a computer analogy to say it \"booted up.\"\nNow he must test if this new artificial Mycoplasma genome can boot up, too — by putting the DNA into a living cell to see if takes over and becomes a synthetic organism.\n\"I don't view that we're creating life,\" Venter told The Associated Press last year in describing this series of experiments. \"I view that we're modifying life to come up with new life forms by designing and synthetically constructing chromosomes.\nAll rights reserved.

Day by day organizations are striving to be transparent and accountable to various stakeholders of the organization to preserve their reputation and brand image. To curtail this problem Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) took initiative towards a better tomorrow. Global Reporting Initiative is a non-profit organization that works towards a sustainable global economy by providing sustainability reporting guidance. Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines defines Sustainability Reporting as “the practice of measuring, disclosing and being accountable to internal and external stakeholders for organizational performance towards the goal of sustainable development”. The first environmental reports were published in 1980s by companies in chemical industry which had serious image problems. Sustainability Reporting is a recent trend forming part of the annual reports of many companies. These reports are intended to improve internal processes, engage stakeholders and influence investors\nRole of CA in Sustainability Reporting:\nA Sustainability Report is an organizational report that gives information about economic, environmental, social and governance performance. Sustainability Reporting is a vital element in Integrated Reporting that has evolved in the recent years portraying both financial and non-financial performance of the organization. GRI Focal Points are national offices that drive GRI activity in particular countries and regions. GRI currently has Focal Points in a number of strategic countries; Australia, Brazil, China, India and the USA. â€‹As we are aware about the supremacy of Institute of chartered Accountants of India in the Accounting and Assurance practices, to extend its wings ICAI joined GRI Focal point of India in 2011. Henceforth CA’s will venture in the administration of sustainability reporting practices of companies along with financial audit and assurance. According to a recent survey more than 50% of the sustainability reports in India are externally assured. So CA’s have a major role to play, not only to audit financials but to assure and monitor the sustainability reports of companies and save the bio-diversity of our nation.\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting:\nAccording to Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Reporting benefits organizations in following ways:\n· Increased understanding of risks and opportunities.\n· Emphasizing the link between financial and non-financial performance.\n· Influencing long term management strategy and business plans.\n· Benchmarking and assessing sustainability performance with respect to laws, norms, codes and voluntary disclosures.\n· Comparing performance internally and between organizations and sectors.\n· Mitigating or reversing negative environmental and social impacts.\n· Improves reputation and brand loyalty.\n· Enabling stakeholders to understand company’s true value.\nThe GRI Five Phase Process: Following are the five phases in the development of Sustainability Reports:\nPhase 1: Prepare\n· Defining the report scope, boundary and time period which will be company specific.\n· Getting started: Linking business goals and sustainability impacts.\nPhase 2: Connect\n· Understanding the importance of stakeholder engagement in the reporting process.\n· Stakeholder identification and prioritization.\n· Effective stakeholder communication.\nPhase 3: Define\n· Identifying relevant sustainability issues for action and reporting.\n· Evaluating existing monitoring systems.\n· Setting goals and performance targets.\nPhase 4: Monitor\n· Adhering to GRI indicators and protocols.\n· Checking processes and monitoring activities.\n· Ensuring quality of information.\nPhase 5: Communicate\n· Maximizing internal and external report value.\n· Incorporating sustainability reporting into traditional annual report.\n· Designing report for clarity and readability\nConclusion: Sustainability Reporting according to me is just not compliance or a mandatory requirement by SEBI for all the top 100 listed companies, but an opportunity for a CA to show his responsibility towards the nation. So being CA,s let’s join hands and give our share in protecting the ecological balance.",

    "What is a heart-lung machine?\nA heart-lung machine—also called a cardiopulmonary bypass machine—is a device that takes over the function of the body’s heart and lungs during open heart or traditional surgery. The machine circulates the essential oxygen-rich blood to the brain and other vital organs during open-heart surgery, allowing the cardiac surgery team to operate on a heart that is blood-free and still. When the surgery is complete, the heart is restarted and the heart-lung machine is disconnected.\nThe heart-lung machine intercepts the blood at the right atrium (upper heart chamber) before it passes into the heart. Using a pump, the machine delivers the blood to a reservoir, which adds oxygen to the blood. The pump then sends the oxygen-rich blood to the aorta and through the rest of the body.\nThe machine, which is operated by a trained and certified specialist called a perfusion technologist, also removes carbon dioxide and other waste products from the blood and delivers anesthesia and medications into the recirculated blood. Also, in some cases, it cools the blood. Cool blood lowers the body’s temperature, which helps to further protect the brain and other vital organs during surgery.\nIf you or someone close to you is experiencing a potential heart problem, call 911 in case of an emergency.

    "Advocates of same-sex “marriage” present the idea as a step forward for tolerance and respect. But recent developments place that interpretation very much in doubt.\nLegalizing same-sex “marriage” is not a stand-alone policy, independent of all the other activities of the state. Once governments assert that same-sex unions are the equivalent of marriage, those governments must defend and enforce a whole host of other social changes.\nUnfortunately, these government-enforced changes conflict with a wide array of ordinary liberties, including religious freedom and ordinary private property rights.\nIt began with the persecution of Catholic Charities in Boston. The archdiocese eventually closed down its adoption program, because the state of Massachusetts insisted that every adoption agency in the state must allow same-sex couples to adopt.\nRecently, a Methodist organization in New Jersey lost part of its tax-exempt status because it refused to allow two lesbian couples to use their facility for a civil union ceremony. In Quebec, a Mennonite school was informed that it must conform to the official provincial curriculum, which includes teaching homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle.\nAt last report, the Mennonites were considering leaving the province rather than permit the imposition of the state-sponsored curriculum on their children.\nAnd recently, a wedding photographer in New Mexico faces a hearing with the state’s Human Rights Commission because she declined the business of a lesbian couple. She didn’t want to take photos of their commitment ceremony.\nThe underlying pattern is unmistakable. Legalizing same-sex “marriage” has brought in its wake state regulation of other parts of society. The problem is sometimes presented as an issue of religious freedom, and so, in part, it is. But the issue runs deeper than religious freedom.\nMcGill University professor Douglas Farrow argues in his book A Nation of!@#$% that redefining marriage allows the government to colonize all of civil society.\nIf same-sex couples can marry each other, they should be allowed to adopt. Anyone who says otherwise is acting against the policy of the state. If same-sex couples can have civil unions, then denying them the use of any facility they want for their ceremony amounts to unlawful discrimination. When the state says that same sex couples are equivalent to opposite-sex couples, school curriculum will inevitably have to support this claim.\nMarriage between men and women is a pre-political, naturally emerging social institution. Men and women come together to create children, independently of any government. The duty of caring for those children exists even without a government or any political order.\nMarriage protects children as well as the interests of each parent in their common project of raising those children.\nBecause marriage is an organic part of civil society, it is robust enough to sustain itself, with minimal assistance from the state.\nBy contrast, same-sex “marriage” is completely a creation of the state.\nSame-sex couples cannot have children. Someone must give them a child or at least half the genetic material to create a child. The state must detach the parental rights of the opposite-sex parent and then attach those rights to the second parent of the same-sex couple.\nThe state must create parentage for the same-sex couple. For the opposite-sex couple, the state merely recognizes parentage.\nIn her essay in The Meaning of Marriage, Seana Sugrue argues that the state must coddle and protect same-sex “marriage” in ways that opposite-sex marriage does not require.\nPrecisely because same-sex unions are not the same as opposite-sex marriage, the state must intervene to make people believe (or at least make them act as if they believe) that the two types of unions are equivalent.\nPublic schools in California are soon going to be required to be “gay friendly.” A doctor has been sued because she didn’t want to perform an artificial insemination on a lesbian couple. A private school is in trouble for disciplining two female students for kissing. All in the name of supporting the rights of same-sex couples to “equality” with straight couples.\nThe fact that opposite- and same-sex couples are different in significant ways means that there will always be scope for the state to expand its reach into more and more private areas of more and more people’s lives.\nPerhaps some people think it is okay to shut down Catholic adoption agencies, because the Catholics have it coming to them: The Church’s enemies are many. Perhaps some people don’t care for Methodists, and don’t care whether they lose their tax-exempt status.\nBut the Mennonites? These are the most inoffensive people on the planet. They have been pacifists for centuries. Their continued existence here in North America is a testimony to the strength of our ideals of religious tolerance and pluralism, in all the best senses of those terms. But now, in the name of equality of same-sex couples, the Mennonites are being driven out of Quebec.\nPerhaps you think people have a natural civil right to marry the person of their choosing. But can you really force yourself to believe that wedding photography is a civil right?\nMaybe you believe that same-sex couples are entitled to have children, somehow. But is any doctor they might encounter required to inseminate them?\nAdvocates of same-sex “marriage” insist that theirs is a modest reform: a mere expansion of marriage to include people currently excluded. But the price of same-sex “marriage” is a reduction in tolerance for everyone else, and an expansion of the power of the state.\nJennifer Roback Morse is the senior fellow in economics at the Acton Institute and the author of Love and Economics: It Takes a Family to Raise a Village, newly reissued in paperback.",

    "Photograph by Timothy Archibald\nForget Freud and his interpretations. Statistics are the key to unlocking the meaning of dreams, says Bill Domhoff, a psychologist and sociologist at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Along with his colleagues, Domhoff has broken thousands of dreams into coded elements such as characters, emotions, settings, and types of social interactions. By performing statistical analyses of these elements, the researchers can study what we dream about and perhaps begin to develop data-driven theories about why we dream. Domhoff discussed his work with Discover\nassociate editor Kathy A. Svitil. Do we know why we dream?\nI'm unimpressed with any evidence that dreams have a function or a purpose. I think they are an accidental by-product of two great evolutionary advances: sleep and improved cognitive abilities. Dreaming is a kind of freewheeling thinking that the mind goes through when there is no external input to bring it back to reality. If that is true, then is there any value in dream interpretation?\nI think it is a scam. I recently went through Freud's masterwork, pulling out every assertion and comparing it with the systematic empirical studies conducted over the past 75 years, including my own. I don't find support for a single one of Freud's specific claims. Freud said all dreams are wishful, for instance, but there is a lot of evidence against that. I've given up on Jung as well. It's sad that these theories continue to attract so much attention when they are clearly not adequate. We ought to move on. So what determines the things we dream about?\nDreams express our conceptions of ourselves and of people close to us. If I take 100 of a person's dreams, and I study his interaction patterns with his parents, siblings, and friends in those dreams, I can then predict his relationships in waking life. Do you find any larger patterns in the content of people's dreams?\nThere's a lot of overlap, but there are differences by age, by gender, by personality, and by culture. The most striking differences have to do with physical aggression. There is little of it in the dreams of children, but it increases in the teenage years. Men's dreams have more aggression than women's. Almost invariably, smaller societies have more physical aggression in their dreams than do Americans: They are killing animals, being attacked by animals, which is much closer to their daily life. But Americans have more physical aggression in their dreams than do the Swiss and the Dutch. Does that mean our society is more aggressive?\nIt certainly fits with the fact that we kill each other far more frequently. You've found that people have the same basic dreams over and over. What does that tell you?\nI don't know, but no dream theory can account for it. A person suffers a traumasay September 11and several months later starts having an upsetting dream about it. Five or 10 years later, the same person may be doing well in his waking life, but he is still having that dream. The Freudians would say the dream proves the problem is unresolved. But does it prove anything? Dreams may simply run on their own track. What is the biggest misconception people have about dreams?\nThat they are often about sexuality. Most dreams are about aggression. Only 10 percent or less of dream content involves sexuality. Dreams don't have much eroticism, and certainly not much pleasant eroticism. People dream they are with the wrong person, someone is watching, they feel guilty. When people talk about having great sex dreams, they are usually talking about daydreaming, not actual dreams.",
    "The caliber.308 Winchester (Also known as 7.62mm NATO or 7.62 x 51 mm) Was developed by the North American army between 1940/1950 and in 1952 Winchester introduced in the civilian market under the name of.308 Winchester. In 1954 it was adopted by NATO.The development of this new caliber occurred after the World War II, trailing the 7.92 Kurz. This cartridge was developed in the German end of the 2nd War for the new weapon StG44. The 7.92 Kurz was developed after research of the German High Command concluded that the 7.92 Mauser in use was more powerful than necessary because the fighting of War 2 were very different from the First (to combat short distance and rapid movement of troops fighting versus long distance with entire armies entrenched ). So it was decided that a smaller cartridge with range of 800 meters, would be ideal for the \" new \" war. The 7.92 Kurz is basically a shortened Mauser 7.92. Probably some copies of this cartridge German fell into the hands of the Allies and the Russians who, realizing the new possibilities of new ammunition, quickly developed their short : the 7.62 x51mm American, a 30-06 Springfield (cartridge used by the U.S. military America at the 2nd World War) and the shortened 7.62 x39mm Russian, a 7.62 x54mmR the Mosin -Nagant used by the Russians in the 2nd War shortened. The new cartridges were \" mere \" shortenings cartridge pre-existing because it facilitates the conversion of weapons of a caliber to another.\nSoon after the adoption of a new cartridge after the war by the Americans, the cartridge was adopted as standard by NATO. The funny fact is that a.280 Enfield cartridge ran with the 7.62 x51mm for the standard to be eventually lost. Sixty years after the army - American (who strongly \" encouraged \" to adopt the 7.62 x51mm ) is testing a new cartridge of the same caliber of the.280 Enfield, the 6.8 Rem SPC mm.",
    "© NASA, CXC, M. Weiss.\nWhen cosmic microwave photons pass through a galaxy cluster, about 1 percent of them scatter off of hot electrons in the gas filling the space between galaxies in the cluster. This is called the \"Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.\" When the photons scatter, they gain energy from the electrons. Thus, galaxy clusters appear in a map of the CMB as cold spots at the original photon frequency, and hot spots at a higher frequency. Microwave telescopes such as the South Pole Telescope can detect galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, while x-ray telescopes such as Chandra can map the hot gas that scattered the CMB photons. These measurements together allow astronomers to measure the growth of structure in the universe. (Unit: 11)",
    "Overcoming perceived GIS resource limitations\nThis module (Teaching with GIS) is designed to highlight GIS concepts that may be added to many geoscience topics and exercises. In particular, we focus on using GIS at the level of introductory geoscience; however, many of the exercises and concepts may be applied in upper level courses as well. We will attempt to answer the following questions:\nDo I need to be a GIS wizard to introduce GIS concepts in my courses?\nAnswer: No! There are numerous web-based mapping utilities, some of which are specifically designed for geoscience applications. In addition, consumer-grade GPS devices and mapping software are both cheaper and easier to learn than the professional GIS/GPS tools.\nMany students new to geoscience are unfamiliar with mapping concepts that we take for granted as professional scientists. Even simple geographic and cartographic concepts can help them understand more complex GIS tasks at a later stage. The introduction of hands-on map creation/interpretation exercises and the associated terminology can greatly enhance the learning experience of the students.\nAren't the hardware and software requirements of GIS prohibitive at the introductory level?\nAnswer: No! There are many options that may be pursued despite resource limitations or student difficulties with computer tasks. Below are some ideas on what can be accomplished with different levels of resource availability or student background. Keep in mind that this site is focused on how we can introduce GIS within existing introductory geoscience courses:\nHardware-limited options—There is little or no access to computers/internet or GPS receivers by students and/or instructor within the classroom. The students often have access to computers and the internet in public labs or have personal computers. Faculty usually have access to the internet on their computers and may have access to some GIS software.\n- Instructor generates maps for exercises/labs utilizing online resources\n- Utilize traditional paper maps (e.g. geologic maps) to introduce concepts of data-driven maps\n- Assign homework exercises that access online resources from student-owned or campus computer labs\nSoftware-limited options—Some access to computers/internet and GPS receivers, but little or no GIS software for student/instructor use in or out of the classroom.\n- Instructor generates maps for exercises/labs from online sources or GIS software. Note that there is GIS shareware available (e.g. GRASS (more info) ).\n- GPS use in lab exercises, particulary field labs\n- Shareware utilities to download GPS data to computer\n- MS Excel or other software used to analyze and plot data in x-y coordinates (convert from lat/lon in GPS software)\n- Manual digitization of data locations\n- Paper maps or using graphics editing software\nNo hardware/software limitations—easy access to computers/internet, GPS receivers, and GIS software in and out of the classroom.\n- All of the more limited options listed above are possible\n- Student use of GIS hardware/software/data in classroom or lab\n- Possibilities limited only by time for GIS within the syllabus",
    "Why does Japan sell meat from research whaling?\nMost of the whales captured by Japanese research whalers can expect some of their tastier portions to come face-to-face with a dinner plate in the not-too-distant future. Critics point their fingers at this practice, deeming the scientific permitting process a thinly veiled excuse for overt commercial fishing operations. But the fact is that whalers, whatever their true motivation, are required by law to make as much use of their ostensible research subjects as they can.\nThe Law of the Sea\nThe International Whaling Commission, which dictates whaling regulations worldwide, set this rule in the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, drafted in 1946. It took until 1986 to restrict legal whaling practices to scientific and limited aboriginal whaling, but even back in the '40s, the IWC wanted to make one thing perfectly clear: If you're going to catch whales, don't let them go to waste.\nIt did not, however, feel the need to put this command into crystal clear language, judging by the cryptic passage in question:\n\"Any whales taken under these special permits shall so far as practicable be processed and the proceeds shall be dealt with in accordance with directions issued by the overnment by which the permit was granted.\"\nSo, after the Japanese whalers make off with all the whale organs they intend to study (ear plugs, ovaries, the stomach and that sort of thing), they do their best to sell the rest, fulfill the terms of the commission's rules and, ideally, turn a profit while they're at it.\nShow Me the Money\nSo where do the profits from the whale meat sales go? Well, it's pretty much a closed loop. Most of the profits help foot the bill for more whaling. In 2001, for example, whale meat totaling 1,803 metric tons was sold after the season ended, and 70 metric tons went unsold, according to the Independent. That might seem like a lot, but when you consider that in 1962 — a peak year for whale hunting — some 230,000 metric tons of meat made its way into hungry Japanese tummies, it helps put things into perspective. While the Japanese still hunt whales, they do so with much less zeal than they did in the past.\nAnd when it comes to actual money, according to Japan Today and Makoto Ito, the managing director of Kyodo Senpaku (the company that performs the whale hunts), the entire whaling operation doesn't really turn much of a profit. He said it costs between about $65 to $75 million a year — with the government kicking in about $5 million and the rest funded by whale meat sales. They claim to barely break even.",
    "An omnibus bill is a proposed law that covers a number of diverse or unrelated topics. Omnibus is derived from Latin and means \"for everything\". An omnibus bill is a single document that is accepted in a single vote by a legislature but packages together several measures into one or combines diverse subjects.\nBecause of their large size and scope, omnibus bills limit opportunities for debate and scrutiny. Historically, omnibus bills have been used to pass controversial amendments. For this reason omnibus bills are considered anti-democratic.\nIn the United States examples include reconciliation bills, combined appropriations bills, and private relief and claims bills. Omnibus legislation is routinely used by the United States Congress to group together the budgets of all departments in one year in an omnibus spending bill. In Canada one famous omnibus bill became the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69, a 126-page, 120-clause amendment to the Criminal Code of Canada, which dealt with issues as diverse as homosexuality, prostitution, abortion, gambling, gun control and drunk driving. In the Republic of Ireland the Second Amendment was an omnibus constitutional law, enacted in 1941, that made many unrelated changes to the state's fundamental law.\n|This legislature-related article is a stub.

    "kick the can\nA classic children’s game, Kick the Can has elements of hide and seek, tag, and capture the flag in its game play. The rules of the game are simple and can be played outdoors in a variety of settings, including back yards, streets, or open spaces that allow for hiding places for children.\nRather than using a ball, the only piece of equipment is an object that can be kicked. The name of the game is Kick the Can, because often a discarded empty can from the trash is used that can have rocks inserted into it to make noise. The game was a popular pickup game for children during difficult economic times. The origin of the game is unknown, but during the Great Depression in the 1930s the game was a popular pastime for children because it didn’t require any designated equipment or playing field.1\nThere are many variations of the game, but the common elements include a person who is “it” who looks for children who are hiding. The can is set up in the middle of an open area with the “it” person nearby. He counts to a pre-determined number with his eyes closed to allow the other players time to hide. When time is up, he begins to look for the hidden children.\nOnce he spies a player, he calls out their name and hiding place, and then they both race to the can to see who can kick the can first. Some variations allow for just finding the person or for tagging him. If the hider kicks the can first, the game is started over with the “it” person giving the player time to hide again. However, if the “it” person kicks the can first, the other player is placed in “jail” which is a designated area for captured players to be kept until rescued.2\nAny hidden player can risk being caught and attempt to rescue his jailed friends by racing to the can and kicking it before the “it” person can kick it. If he is successful, all the players in jail are released, and the “it” person must count again as players hide. Hidden players can strategically move around to other hiding places to keep out of sight and to maneuver to better positions to rescue jailed players.3\nThe game is over when the “it” person has successfully jailed all the players or a set designated time has expired.\n- 1.

    "When it comes to eating “right”, there is a lot more than just nutrition to think about. One must also consider the process behind food production and what it takes to get food to the plate. Meat, in particular, has a pretty troubling back story.\nNot only does meat raise questions of ethical and moral standing, but it also has creates problems environmentally – not to mention the strong arguments against its use as a regular food group. Because of these things, many people have found it healthy, ethically appealing, and environmentally wise to quit meat or limit the consumption of meat.\nAnyone who has grown up with the food knows that’s no easy task. Here are a few strategies that help you along the way!\nEase off Gradually\nJust like anything, don’t expect to quit cold turkey (no pun intended). Quitting meat can start by choosing just one day out of the week not to eat meat. Easing off gradually is especially useful if those you regularly dine with are big meat eaters – it gives you a chance to test out your new commitment and discuss it with those who will see the change.\nAt first, start out small – perhaps just with certain meals. Lunch is an especially easy meal to turn vegetarian (or vegan) because many people are looking for something lighter, refreshing, and energizing to get them through the rest of the day – a salad packed with healthy vegetables will do just that.\nAs you progress, aim for 4 out of 7 days without meat. Go up to the point of you goal, and even consider going past it.\nMove Type by Type\nAnother good tip is to quit meat by meat. That is, first quit pork, then beef, then chicken, etc. By knocking out particular ‘meat groups’, you allow yourself some foot room in the fight against meat. You may have been off beef and pork for 2 weeks, but are craving something meaty – grab an free range, organic chicken leg! Just be prepared to eventually switch that out with something if you are planning on going completely meat-free!\nKeep Yourself Healthy\nAbove all, be sure you are still getting the proper nutrients with every meal. By far, not being healthy and not eating a well rounded meal will negatively affect changing your diet more than anything else. Besides, what’s the use of quitting meat if you’re not conscious enough to see the health benefits. Work vigilantly at making sure you have all you macronutirents covered – legumes, dark leafy greens, and hearty vegetables can help fill the void of meat, making them staples of the healthy meal.\nDevelop a healthy meal plan to ensure you’re getting the vitamins and minerals your body needs to keep going!\nLiving Meat Free\nAfter taking steps like these, you’ll be well on your way to living meat free (or meat limited). From that, less pollution will be spilled into water supplies and released into air, fewer animals will suffer through the behemoth that is industrial food processing, and your body will begin to operate more efficiently, leading to better health. Just remember – it doesn’t happen overnight and it will require real commitment out of you!",

    "MINNEAPOLIS - Sinkholes can swallow up earth in an instant and cause damage or even worse. A sinkhole in Florida claimed the life of a 36-year-old man on Thursday.\n\"They can be unpredictable,\" said Greg Brick, author of the book \"Subterranean Twin Cities.\" \"It's why we have an entire profession, geotechnical engineering.\"\nSinkholes happen in Minnesota, too. Some occur naturally like the massive indention in the Longfellow neighborhood of Minneapolis; a sinkhole 30 feet deep which occurred 3,000 years ago. Others can be caused by broken water mains.

Antibiotics commonly used for oral treatment include doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil. Patients with certain neurological or cardiac forms of illness may require intravenous treatment with drugs such as ceftriaxone or penicillin. For detailed recommendations on treatment, consult the 2006 Guidelines for treatment developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\nApproximately 10-20% of patients (particularly those who were diagnosed later), following appropriate antibiotic treatment, may have persistent or recurrent symptoms and are considered to have Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS).
